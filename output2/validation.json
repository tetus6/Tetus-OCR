Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis. With best wishes. Yours sincerely, Oey Stebbing Enc. 019341",

The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to encourage submission of a Full Application. Their decision is based not only on scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for inclusion in one of the Council’s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes about two months. In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You will also find in this package our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, [or Arthur D. Eisenberg encl. B",

Kabat Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine Albert Einstein College of Medicine Belfer Building Rm. 1302 1300 Mortis Park Avenue Bronx, NY 10461-1601 Dear Dr. Kabat: I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL.

Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in childhood as 0.90 for (Le., any exposure), 1.12 for “I smoker in the household,” and 1.13 smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the R's for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is, unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe, be incorrect. Tealeulated crude OR’s and Cl’s from your published case and control counts for each exposure category and was surprised to find thatthe crude results for “yes/no” identically replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142 that “{u}nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2 contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state ifthe results in Table 2 are, or are not, adjusted, My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household” vwas 0.93 (95% Cl: 0.42-2.06) and for “2+ smokers in the houschold” was 0.87 (95% Cl: 0,31-2.45).

UNIS- POOL will provide the user with the capability of printing to devices on either system. Preliminary testing indicates that the software meets all expectations. The Licensing Agreerent is being evaluated. Analytical Support for Applied R&D Study Analytical support is continuing for an Applied R&D study on the effect of product tampering with cyanide. Because of the deliquescent properties of cyanide salts, undetectable contamina- tion of tobacco with lethal levels appears unlikely. To insure maximum safety of personnel conducting analyses, a personai HCN monitor was purchased and implemented. This device will alarm when concentration of HCN exceeds 10 ppm. In addition, Dr. Lewis of our Medical Department has discussed emergency procedures should accidental KCN poisoning occur.

We wish to thank you again for your financial ‘contribution of last year that helped make the 1991 meeting a great success.. For this coming fall, we are organizing a symposium on Molecular Signalling and Cell Structure. Understanding the molecular and structural basis for the transmission of regulatory information from membrane to nucleus is among the central contemporary issues in molecular oncology and cell biology, and this symposium should help fo coalesce emerging ideas on the topic. se hom Participants include Thomas Pollard Hopkins), Thomas Stossel (Brigham and Women’s Hospital), Timothy Springer (Rockefeller University), Thomas Leto (NIH), Colin Hopkins (MRC, England), and Inder Verma (Salk Institute). The topies to be discussed range from on cell structure and growth factor receptors to the analysis of gene expression. We feel that this conference is particularly timely and will help to focus on new ideas regarding cell-cell interactions, cell structure and cell signalling. Given the nature of the topic and the outstanding quality ofthe scientific participants, we expect this symposium to be a major event in this rapidly developing field. We are writing to ask your financial support for this symposium, Funds willbe sed to partially offset the costs of travel and local expenses of the speakers.

We are pleased to recognize Carr's efforts with this promotion. One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the challenge to build this program and has made significant progress to reach his goal, He has carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company. These articles are being submitted for publication in Peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts. Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientific rigor to the question of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Carr was actively involved in responding to the EPA and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientific facts, In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and responsibilities of a Senior Staff Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted to have him as part of our team.

Dickerson I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-1OP, scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The product, which is being mailed for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining consumer test data ona \"no-nicotine\" protocept. The LNA-10V product has a . blend nicotine of 0.118 and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette. Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05-0.06% in Merit Free and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to 0.06 in Merit Free and Next. The low nicotine in LNA-10V was obtained through conventional denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-10P product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In theory, the LNA-10P approach will give approximately the same nicotine value as the LNA-10V approach, using tobacco blends in inventory. If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water extraction is being changed significantly. Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to producing material for one consumer test. I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-10P until we have done a more thorough job of process and formulation development. Dickerson g By 8 xe: Mr. D. R. Pugh Mr. W. M.

Or the patients suffer the side effects of chemotherapy, including naudea, loss of hair, and infections. These are the [dreadful of smoking. And these sane ill effects can haypen to non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke. ‘the smoking proviuions are the antithesis of good practices. smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. | Let me the record utraight on a fev issues raised by the | i © only one of four veterans smoke.

Wise, Jr. House of Representatives Washington, Dc 20515 Pear Wiset My as Secretary of Veterans Affairs is to provide a safe patient environment. Anerica’s proud veterans, Whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch on which to base their dignity. It ss inherent. Recently, you received a letter from Representatives Wise and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions in H.R. They would have you believe that it is a matter of dignity to permit smoking inside VA health care facilities. The issue 1s not dignity -- the is health care. consider those who must endure catheters in the or artery, or ventilation tubes to enable breathing, because smoking has so impaired their health. Or the patients suffer the side effects of chemotherapy, including naudea, loss of hair, and infections. These are the [dreadful of smoking. And these sane ill effects can haypen to non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke. ‘the smoking proviuions are the antithesis of good practices. smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. | Let me the record utraight on a fev issues raised by the | i © only one of four veterans smoke. We provide dutdoor smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Longjterm and chronic care patients can still purchase tobaqco from VA canteens with medical approval of their physicians. We have instituted smoking programs to assiut patients and employees who|wish to step sacking. i © The veteran who chooses to does so of his own accord. VA's policy establishes medical center environments that encourage non-smoking behavior, particularly among people who already have major health problens which are aggravated by and protects those who do not smoke and who can b¢ damaged by exposure to others’ snoke. i \\ 2 : i ! >",

Various blends, top-dressings, and processing changes were evaluated to reduce the off taste and off aroma associated with the M-2000 process for nicotine removal. Although some reduction of the off taste and off arona have been accomplished by renoving the burley tobacco from the blend, changing from freon to pentane, modifying M-2000 processing conditions, and improved top-dressing, a definite off taste and off sidestream aroma in the smoke is still present, The off flavor and undesirable sidestream aroma are apparently inherent to the M-2000 process.

Perfetti Flavor Division, PA&T Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter Sheet Material The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaC03. (Sample'G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to 30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal- ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 + 2985 ig/cigarette, i.e. 4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 ig/cigarette) and silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066 ug silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS. The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaC03 present in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash 599%. The amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette. As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G). jomas A.

Chairman, Committee on Commerce : United States Senate Washington, D.C, : Dear Senator Magnuson: As a past President of the Association of State and Territorial Health - and the representative of that Association on the National Interagency, Council on Smoking and Health, I have been designated by our Association to write to you to express the opinion of our Association concerning S. 559 and S. SAT. These bills are concerned with federal requirements for cigarette labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Gommereé for consideration, At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, composed of the health of each state and cach territory of the United States, passed a recom- mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard the state health depaztments and the United States Public Health Service need to develop comprehensive programs to help to bring under control the habit of cigarette smoking. A copy of the Association recommendation is In view of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientilic evidence shows that are in truth a health hazard, we would like to be on record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in'S. 559 or S. 547. We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative factor, such as cancer lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so important today that people who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by continual cigarette smoking, We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its position clearly understood and strengthened as far as labeling and advertieing is concerned. Whether this needs specific wording as to advertising asin $47 or simply leaves the Federal Trade Commission free to propose and undertake such control as it wishes under its existing authority is A matter about « Stich vee do not (eel sufficiently to comment at this time, except fe say that the opinion of the Federal Trade regarding the adve 2° and their ability to administer it should be given adeh weight, : — ea 8 | :",

Chairman, Committee on Commerce : United States Senate Washington, D.C, : Dear Senator Magnuson: As a past President of the Association of State and Territorial Health - and the representative of that Association on the National Interagency, Council on Smoking and Health, I have been designated by our Association to write to you to express the opinion of our Association concerning S. 559 and S. SAT. These bills are concerned with federal requirements for cigarette labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Gommereé for consideration, At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, composed of the health of each state and cach territory of the United States, passed a recom- mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard the state health depaztments and the United States Public Health Service need to develop comprehensive programs to help to bring under control the habit of cigarette smoking. A copy of the Association recommendation is In view of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientilic evidence shows that are in truth a health hazard, we would like to be on record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in'S. 559 or S. 547. We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative factor, such as cancer lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so important today that people who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by continual cigarette smoking, We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its position clearly understood and strengthened as far as labeling and advertieing is concerned. Whether this needs specific wording as to advertising asin $47 or simply leaves the Federal Trade Commission free to propose and undertake such control as it wishes under its existing authority is A matter about « Stich vee do not (eel sufficiently to comment at this time, except fe say that the opinion of the Federal Trade regarding the adve 2° and their ability to administer it should be given adeh weight, : — ea 8 | :",

May I please request an extension without further funding of our grant entitled \"Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human Lung Disease\" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Haretield Hospital, and Mr. John Wallwork from Papworth Hospital, both groups of which are involved in heart lung transplants. @ have done sutficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their localisation in tissue sections. These include, in vitro autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding and In situ hybridisatton/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike earlier days when avaflability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we would very much like to «rite up an exciting extension grant application to the best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new field of investigative pathology.

These tests were performed August 3-11 in Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette, PHASE 111 All examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits for this product. (Attachment 1) ‘SPOTTING/STAINING were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Mch.#10) contained 27 spots and the test (Nch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again at 30 days and at 90 days. CONTAMINATION TESTING/SIEVE ANALYSIS i Fifteen random samples of Netpmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8% plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totale of 19 and 11 found in sim{lar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive, In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately 19% higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and therefore is less objectionable. Steve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36% pass the 14 mesh. (attachment 2) Samples have also been collected from product using 6% plasticizer and three center glue lines. Results from this analysis should be available by August 23. There are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 68 plasticizer filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting & next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are o favorable, RJRTI R&D will approve use of the Neipmann for TI brands.",

        "text": "August 17, 1989 To: Distribution Subject: Neipmann Qualification Testing ‘The following are results of requalification testing of the Neipmann Reclaim unit on VANTAGE Charcoal-Japan production. These tests were performed August 3-11 in Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette, PHASE 111 All examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits for this product. (Attachment 1) ‘SPOTTING/STAINING were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Mch.#10) contained 27 spots and the test (Nch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again at 30 days and at 90 days. CONTAMINATION TESTING/SIEVE ANALYSIS i Fifteen random samples of Netpmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8% plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totale of 19 and 11 found in sim{lar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive, In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately 19% higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and therefore is less objectionable. Steve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36% pass the 14 mesh. (attachment 2) Samples have also been collected from product using 6% plasticizer and three center glue lines. Results from this analysis should be available by August 23. There are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 68 plasticizer filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting & next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are o favorable, RJRTI R&D will approve use of the Neipmann for TI brands.",

Morton Brand R&D INTRODUCTION Sidestrean smoke measurenents were teken on 52 products: 11 prototype Products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurenente were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures reported were visible absorbance values. Each number reported is the average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the sidestream smoke measures. Forty-five products were measured on one device and the renaining 7 were measured on the other. Sone products, a monitor and NOH 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance. The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the 11 prototype Products give off less visible sidestrean smoke than all of the 41 comer- cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurenent devices end the visible sidestrean smoke values for all products in the study were compared. I will first describe the results of a comparison between the two measure- | ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that wes made enong the 52 products. DEVICE COMPARISON 4n analysis of variance on the two measurenent devices shoved en average difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines. (The newer machine read about .0178 lover than the original machine.) That difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two machines, but it is not significant at the standard level. The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigerettes that were used to monitor the machines. The difference was .0185 units for the so-called Monitor (which had an average absorbance of about .75) and -0170 units for NOW 85 (which hed an average absorbance of about .54). o In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assun- ing that the to devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis- 4 ‘tinguisheble from the other products is not changed according to which es- sumption is made.",

Concord St. Boston, MA 02118 Dear Dr. Herrera: Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. | am pleased to enclose a statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminary inauiry is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Couneit’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee's review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a £1 | application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminary inaviries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Fall cycle - any inquiry received between April 1 and September 30 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30. - Spring cycle - inquiries received between October 1 and March 31 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31: Cycle Preliminary Ingiry Deadline for Notification _ Activation 2 Arrival atCTR Full Application Date Date ‘Spring Apr 1 - Sep 30 Nov 30 Early May Tull Fall 1 - Mar 31 May 31 Early Oct The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1, A three page narrative summary. This a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present status and goals, a brief outline of the > research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accomodated within the three page limitation. 2.
