The opinion begins by discussing the procedures Congress had established for EPA to follow in its research program on indoor air quality.

Resce Extended Puff Count, Lower CO Delivery And Improved Conductive Heat Transfer In TGA Modele Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally Conductive Aluminum Summary The conduction-of heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA model back to the substrate (and tobacco) via an aluminun macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum “fingers” which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend the Leagth of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering ite combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate Of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is at a slower rate, and (2) the production of CO via reduction of CO, is decreased because of the lower temperature maintained in thé burning coal. Background Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum nacrocapsule. The fuel source is generally inserted only 1 or 2 Ga inside the The heat must travel from the burning fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the 1 to 2 um to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol = delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the a interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, @ new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel ~ source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where the fuel source is inserted into the capsule but also along these eee",

Today we want to tell you about another important teammate, the Advertising Department. This Department is under the management of Mr. W. T. Smither, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. His Assistant is Mr. Ernest M. Fulp. The 20 employees in the Department are directly supervised by Mr. W. H. Maddrey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N. Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager. The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget authorized. Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the Company’s Sales Representatives in the field.

Bernasek, Dickerson, and I have discussed the type of R&D work which we feel should. be conducted as an extention of -- the HaD Project. We recommend that work be undertaken in RUD to 1) confirm the effect of this type of tobacco processing on smoking characteristics, and 2) determine process(es) RJR should develop.” An outline of the project work and staffing which we recommend for 1984 is attached. Since further evaluation of blends ‘depends on the availability of adequate quantities of the specially processed tobaccos, an attempt was made in late April to produce cast reconstituted sheet at TMCI, Inc. The sample arrived in R&D on Monday. If the smoking characteristics of this material are judged to be acceptable (or close enough to lead us to believe acceptable material can be made at THCI), then the R&D program outlined on the attached document should Cj be feasible for 1984. If this is not the case, the tinetable will be lengthened cansiderably. Recommended staffing for the R&D project is shown on the project outline. The appropriate Managers have been contacted to determine that temporary assignment of the staff : indicated to this project is possible if you approve this Commitment of R&D manpower. Because his time is heavily committed to work on TGA, Dr. Casey is not included in the project staffing. Dr. Dickerson had indicated that a limited amount of his time would be available for consultation, and I will ask Dr. Lloyd if such an arrangement will still be possible. A major objective for in 1984 should be to establish facilities for the production of experimental quantities of cast reconstituted sheet. This along with the planned _ upgrading of the G7 Pilot Plant will put us in a position to conduct process research on either or both of these types of reconstituted sheet. Without such facilities, it will not be possible to conduct research of quality on the type of treatments ndeded. A memorandum is attached which outlines the work which PT&D will conduct in support of this project. Please let me know when you would like to discuss this 3 project. 8 ok ye HB xc: Dr. €.

While the Society is very grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in publications and public appearances and the like, it is not appropriate, it seems to us, to have it listed with the Council for Tobacco Research. For our staff and volunteers this is a conflict at least is the perception. These are the people that bring us products that kill a half million Americans a year, and for the American Cancer Society to be in any way associated and. ‘council for Tobacco Research lends it credipility that is frankly embarrassing. We certainly recognize that the members of the Scientific Advisory Board are a distinguished group of people who are making sincere efforts on behalf of research. Please don’t take this Fequest personally, but I hope you ‘understand the sensitivity that” we have to this issue of tobacco and cancer. They are not very broad minded when it comes to dealing with some investigators that funded by the American Cancer Society who provide information Ghich they don’t like--in fact, the tobacco companies have severely pressured several scientists funded by the Society- wish you continued success and look forward to seeing you at the Professors’ meeting.

In general it is not the policy of The Council to encourage travels to foreign countries for the purpose of presenting a paper unless they are conbined with invitations to working conferences or some particularly needed visit to some laboratories. I am quite sure that no special would be made for this purpose. If it can be done with the support- funds it might be approved if the requested information is available. Sincerely, Willian U. Gardnor, Ph.D. Scientific Director WUG:0k",

Reynolds Tobacco Company 401 North Main Street Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102 For the past seven years I have run a successful sampling program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up-scale adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels and clubs. I was informed today that the hotel sampling program will not be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There have been recent competitive developments which lead me to believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988. The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900 or nineteen-cents a pack, not including the cost of product. This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces has far-reaching sales potential. Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris who has held this program on-line since 1970. We consistently run into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here - in this important market. Indeed we have held a preemptive position versus the competition because we sample seven days a week.

It ; was decided to run the new campaign based on positive results from ' previous research on the Logger execution from the Occupational campaign. This research suggested that individual executions from the new campaign would be impactful and would communicate the 1 brand's strategy of good taste and masculine imagery. However, it was desirable to determine the degree to which the new campaign i might approach the Marlboro campaign in potential for the total i campaign to communicate not only good taste, but more importantly { a desirable smoker imagery. Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows: | 1. Determine potential campaign communication in terms of smoker i imagery and product benefits. i 2. Assess the perception of the Northwoods Logger personality image. | This would be accomplished by: a. Determining whether the personality imagery is highly defined | /single minded. ! b. Determining what is the definition of the personality image. c. Assessing how the personality image of the Northwoods Logger compares to the Marlboro Cowboy and the WINSTON Candid 1 smoker. Summary Of Findings In terms of campaign communication, it appears that the major gain accomplished by the new campaign relative to Candid is communication of a more fully dimensionalized, rugged, masculine smoker imagery. The smoker imagery communicated by the new campaign is much richer than that communicated by Candid and tends to be comparable to that communicated by the Marlboro campaign. Given the greater involve ment of the Northwoods Logger campaign respondents in smoker imagery, the taste communication for the new campaign is somewhat lower than that generated by Candid. However, taste communication for the $ Northwoods Logger campaign.is superior to that achieved by the Fa Marlboro campaign. wo 8",

Penick SUBJECT: MARC INBOUND 800# COST REDUCTION IMPACT MARC’s toll-free cost reduction will impact two of our operational areas: Smoker Recruitment and Product Research. Savings in the 1991 Product Research projects would have totaled $180,000 with MARC’s new toll-free cost. This represents an 8% reduction in their total fieldwork costs. For the smoker recruitment area, the savings are negligible as MARC’s new rate is slightly lower than what we were paying in 1991; and the use of the toll-free operation has been increased significantly with changes in our recruitment document design. Coincidentally, but unrelated to MARC’s inbound cost reduction, Tracker is reducing the cost we were paying for the diary panel recruitment tag-on. This cost reduction will provide a $235m cost avoidance in 1992 and is explained below. $46m was spent with TRACKER in ‘91 for diary panel recruitment. On a cost/complete basis, this cost was more than what we paid MARC for smoker recruiting through SRMS. When questioned about this discrepancy, MARC attributed this cost difference to the different markups each group in MARC used. MARC has standardized this markup, and the price was reduced to $23m. . Instead of reducing the cost of Tracker by $23m, we asked TRACKER to use this money to recruit as many smokers as possible due to the low cost/complete with the new price. This has resulted in doubling the number of smokers recruited. . We also made a procedural change in how these smokers are used. Instead of putting these smokers directly into the diary panel, the smokers will now be placed in the SRMS and allocated where they can provide the greatest benefit. For example, an 18-24 year old Marlboro smoker to a CAMEL product test. This will allow us to maximize savings for the company ($235m estimated in 1992) through the most efficient allocation of resources. If you have any further questions, please call. 20 W. R.

Possibly the greatest area of disagreement between Ancrican Chenosol Corporation and the Industry velated to benzo(a)pyrene analyses Mr. Gargus i stated that such analyses would be perforned routinely on Control and ; Chenosol-treated cigarette condensates. Mr. Beck pressed strongly for making such data available to the Anerican Chewosol Mc. wade it clear that such data would not be released before : Hazleton's final report vas issued. This is a gocd opportunity for me to express my appreciation for the i excellent cooperation, hard work, and scientific competence of Dr. Burke and Mr. Carpenter, ny subcommittee colleagues. It's a shane that so such quality > work has had to be expended on sonethtag like Chenosol. I at also grateful to the Research Directors for their cooperation and understanding, Sincerely yours, Aldon Wielzon (See next page for distribution) 3 4 3 Es",

L. Harris and the other with Harris! information combined with the use of “carbonized” filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal smoking suggests that these Prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating sidestream aroma which ie common to the current CC~prototypes. Dr. Harris has (RSDM, 1982, No. 50; CIM, 1980, No. 27; CIM, 1977, No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without Ca00, filler resulte in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries.” The major is that due to the reduced suolder rate, the puff count 16 extraordinarily high (~20-25 puff/eig). He suggested that unusual . configurations are required to obtain cigarettes with reasonable deliveries and puff counte.

It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS substantial reductions (~50%) in measured sidestream were achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were obtained. Prototype DET~111682-A was similar to that described above except that the filler included 30% “carbonized” flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. White), Mr, White hae that the use of “carbonized” filler in a blend results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The resulte of smoke analyses for this prototype are also presented in Table 1. A comparison of samples A and B shows that the use of “carbonized” filler resulted in further eidestrean ‘tar’ reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as only an upper limit, however. Dr. Harris has demonstrated that the routine method for measurement of sidestream ‘tar’ is in error for cigarettes which contain “carbonized” filler, The actual ‘tar’ delivery is somewhat less than that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS ‘tar' from cigarettes with “carbonized” filler. Thus, all we can say at this point ie that the sidestream 'tar' reduction is in excess of ~60%. ‘The results of visible sidestreem measurenents are unavailable at this time due to the load and priority of CC-prototypes.

I'd like to share my own views, since I've had some experience with the issue. A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers. When they first approached me I considered the situation but, for several reasons, decided against any restrictions. First, implementing smoking policies would have required that I take action against good employees who have worked for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since, as in many offices, employces with similar skills and responsi- bilities work together. Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis- covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither aware of nor particularly interested in the problem. I have not read any of Weis’ articles to which Solmon referred nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggests that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing re- strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me money. Sincerely, . TIOK 0027645",

It will be held April 12-14, 1996.: This symposium will explore the ways both single celled organisms and multicellular organisms establish axes and pattern for asymmetric cell division and embryonic development, and will include discussion of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, algae, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. This letter is written to request financial assistance for our graduate student symposium. ‘This will be the sixteenth symposium organized by the graduate students in MCD Biology. A unique feature of this event is that it is organized and run entirely by graduate students from our department. These symposia allow us to interact with prominent scientists from diverse disciplines one-on-one, and introduce us to. deeper insights into many important questions facing biologists today. These symposia also serve to enliven the scientific atmosphere of the region by bringing prominent biologists from around the world to Boulder, In the past, the Graduate Student Symposium has been made possible by generous donations from biotechnology companies, from companies that do business with | researchers in the Boulder area, and from others interested in biology. The total cost of the symposium, the majority of which is used for transportation and lodging of the speakers, is estimated at 15,000 dollars. Past contributions have ranged from 500 to 3500 dollars. Any contribution would be greatly appreciated, and acknowledged both at the symposium and in the symposium program which is given to each attendee.

Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses, several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists who serve as our peer review committee.

The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two or three years) in'a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forms. The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists.

Background ‘The WINSTON 100's Improved Product program was initiated in February, 1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. ‘The primary reason for WINSTON's lack of preference was its being perceived \"too strong/harsh” \"less smooth/mild\" relative to Marlboro. Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's, It was intended that one of the products would be introduced into an “announced” test market if it met the required action standards, which have since been modified. The new \"announcement\" action standards specify: * Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers. * Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers. {Additional element) * parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers. (Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H) * preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers. * preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target for the 100mm NFF category. * ‘TPM at 17 mgs or less. Test Results 8 Blend 42 demonstrated significant advantages over current 1100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards for “announcement” test market. Test results indicated that blend #2 was: N 8 3 7",

Background ‘The WINSTON 100's Improved Product program was initiated in February, 1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. ‘The primary reason for WINSTON's lack of preference was its being perceived \"too strong/harsh” \"less smooth/mild\" relative to Marlboro. Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's, It was intended that one of the products would be introduced into an “announced” test market if it met the required action standards, which have since been modified. The new \"announcement\" action standards specify: * Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers. * Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers. {Additional element) * parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers. (Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H) * preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers. * preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target for the 100mm NFF category. * ‘TPM at 17 mgs or less. Test Results 8 Blend 42 demonstrated significant advantages over current 1100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards for “announcement” test market. Test results indicated that blend #2 was: N 8 3 7",

As you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with P.M. and BAT; however, shortly after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they needed us on contract as well. ‘The current backbar setup for cigaretles (see pictures attached) is 8’ long and 8.4’ high. P.M. has 4' or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per month. BAT has the top portion of the other 4’ section or 25%, and has maximized their payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of 8’ from the counter to the backbar, our space is all very visible. ‘The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4° section with them. This just didn't make good business sense. Ifyou have any questions, please feel free to contact me. g 8 Sincerely, = Don F. Knoll Account Executive",

Flavor support for SALEM Products, in the SALEM KS and SALEM Light 85 styles, were : made by Brand R&D using cavity filters containing various i levels of menthol laden polymer beads. At their request, menthol formulations of cut filler application were designed to simulate the same menthol deliveries as the above prototypes. Calculations for these topdressings were based on the analyses obtained from the menthol content in the tobacco and the polymer beads. An aging study will be conducted by Brand R&D on the comparison of these two menthol products: mentholated beads in filter versus mentholated cut filler. It was also recommended to Brand R&D that a comparison of the puff-by-puff smoke menthol profiles is essential information if a true delivery of menthol agains time basis is to be understood.

I have followed your advice and have outlined the research projects being in- vestigated in my laboratory. I trust this information will be considered by the Scientific Advisory Board, and I lock forward to their decision. 1. Background ~ We are investigating the biological and biochemical aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan et al., 1978). In the last year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated that the EHV-] and EHV-2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart, bone, and CNS); the EHV-3 transformed cells have been inoculated into hamsters within the last two weeks. In the case of the EHV-1 system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines harbor viral DNA sequences (3-20% of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/cell). Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages) passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors), and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by 1) demon- and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence. Presently, blot hybridization analyses are being carried out in which individual restriction endonuclease fragments (labeled to high specific activity by nick translation) 50222862",

I have followed your advice and have outlined the research projects being in- vestigated in my laboratory. I trust this information will be considered by the Scientific Advisory Board, and I lock forward to their decision. 1. Background ~ We are investigating the biological and biochemical aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan et al., 1978). In the last year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated that the EHV-] and EHV-2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart, bone, and CNS); the EHV-3 transformed cells have been inoculated into hamsters within the last two weeks. In the case of the EHV-1 system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines harbor viral DNA sequences (3-20% of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/cell). Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages) passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors), and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by 1) demon- and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence. Presently, blot hybridization analyses are being carried out in which individual restriction endonuclease fragments (labeled to high specific activity by nick translation) 50222862",

Overview Consideration will be given in the 100th Congress to increasing the Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes in 1987. RJR Public Affairs predicts that if an increase is in fact legislated, there is a 70% probability it would take effect October 1, 1987, and a 30% probability it would be effective July 1, 1987, In either case, the most likely increase will be either 8¢ or 10¢ per pack. Depending on the timing and magnitude of an increase, Industry volume is expected to decline 2.9% to 3.8¢ as a result. These declines are incremental to the forecast industry baseline trend (-1.7%). RJRT volume is estimated to experience a commensurate decline with total Industry. This estimate is based on the fact that RIRT currently has its fair share, or 32.3% of the Savings Segment. Consequently, RJRT is expected to maintain share. While RJRT volume should not decline disproportionately versus the total Industry, it is expected that a significant shift in Pull Price vs. Savings Brand volume mix will occur. For example, under an 8¢ increase effective 10/1/87 scenario, RJR Full Price volume is projected to decline about 1.7 billion and Savings volume projected to increase by .4 billion.

Perfetti BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM © Several additional studies have been designed for Brands RED during the third quarter of 1984. The major enphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening, in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables. ‘CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM Xo end FFLT Non-Nenthol Consumer Nodes Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-nenthol cigarettes. These models have been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for ‘the following smoker groups testing RJR products: © FF competitive snokers © FF franchise snokers © FELT competitive snokers © FFLT franchise snckers The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational terms, and of these. Results from these studies have been presented at the September HINSION Task Force meeting and the Septenber MDM meeting. © FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models Analytical data and NFO data are presently being collected on 200 additional cases for the developnent of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted to NFO between 1981 and 1964. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been completed.

Here is one item we wanted to discuss: Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan. I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with Hogshead. H.J. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday. As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. J. were going to propose that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings display, alongside Doral, They would not benefit from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success. According to R.P., I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as another footprint. At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and switch it out with existing RIR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a month instead of Doral, and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc. ‘© That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do, i.e, fall partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock more conventional approach. = ‘We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart, I just wanted 3 you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation, 8",

I. Long Term 1) Continued growth of Savings Seqment - SALEM particularly vulnerable due to franchise profile - Represents a source of high switching losses for SALEM 2) Continued decline of 18 - 34 year old target smokers among both General Market and Black Market smokers ~ Losses of \"quits\" are not being offset by gains from \"new\" which places longer-term downward pressure on SALEM’s share trend TI. Short Term 1) Increased competitive price/promotion pressure - Higher Savings Segment pressure including probable expansion of Alpine in 1988 and 1989 - Proliferation of menthol line extensions g = New strategy by B&W to place market support behind volume for Kool, typically a major a contributor to SALEN switching gains 2 8 . 8",

A new budget sheet is enclosed for this purpose. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with applications to other agencies.

We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of expenditures and commitments. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office will stop further grant payments.

Held, Director State Prevention Systems Program Center for Substance Abuse Prevention Rockwall II Building, 9th Floor 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville, Maryland 20857 Dear Ms, Held: ‘As a wholesaler in Dlinois, I am very disturbed about the Department of Health and ‘Human Services’ (HHS) proposed rules regarding the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors under Section 1926 of the Public Health Service Act. I would like to take this opportunity to articulate some of my concerns. As you may know, the Illinois state legislature has already dealt effectively with this issue by attaching criminal penalties to the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors. Furthermore, retailers, wholesalers and other businesses in the state work very hard to censure that they comply with the law. I am offended that HHS assumes we have fallen down on the job and has decided to take matters into its own hands (without the consent of Congress) by proposing new, excessive regulations. How does HHS propose to pay for these regulations? On the backs of small businesses and retailers who already carry a tremendous regulatory burden. HHS estimates that the proposed rules will cost $150 million in compliance law-enforcement costs. As I understand it, HHS suggests that these costs be passed onto retailers in the form of licensing fees, These fees are unfair and could potentially jeopardize the health of struggling small business community, Finally, I strongly disagree with the use of children and \"private entities\" for law enforcement purposes. How can HHS suggest that young children be used in “sting” operations that have them break the law? It is not only counter-intuitive but it is also dangerous. As for \"private entities\", I have faith that the law enforcement officials in Mlinois can do the job of enforcing the laws.

Bowman-Gray Technical Center Reynolds Blvd. Winston-Salem, NC 27105 Dear Mike, Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities. Summary of Activities SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS ~~ Priority #1 Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering. Oxide additives such as Nay and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

Bowman-Gray Technical Center Reynolds Blvd. Winston-Salem, NC 27105 Dear Mike, Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities. Summary of Activities SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS ~~ Priority #1 Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering. Oxide additives such as Nay and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

The objective of this development pathway has been to reduce the smoke nicotine yield versus the current nicotine yield by a minimum of 50%. The objective has been met with both prototypes which were produced for this consumer testing. Prototype #1 utilizes a blend composed solely of low nicotine off-shore tobacco. This product achieves a smoke nicotine reduction of just over 50%. Prototype #2 uses the same base blend except that the Part II burley and flue-cured was denicotinized on the FS-2001 pilot line with a double pass to simulate a Single pass through #605. This product achieves a 63% reduction in smoke nicotine. Mailout of the test products occurred the week of 4/17; results are due 6/5. A Fourth Quarter 1989 test market introduction is planned. VANTAGE LN 85 Prototypes The objective of the VANTAGE LN is to design products which deliver 50% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. Two of the developed Prototypes are variations of the VANTAGE 100 blend, while the third Prototype is a modified WINSTON Lights/CAMEL Lights blend.

Closer to home, ottr ovn laboratory has been doing a considerable amount of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions - which would imply that the hazard of radon + smoking is larger than the sum of the hazards from radon alone and smoking alone. Qur end point will be in-vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a seminar - or a more informal discussion - on tobacco research in general?

There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar | principle, ic, prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95 to 98% for smoke particles are usual claims (LR&G's 996 to 99.9% seems unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or disprove this data. I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle filters apparently clog fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If one inserts a more efficient filter, I would expect it to clog more quickly and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however, is again subject to proper I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of ‘charcoal would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose efficiency as absorbers of odors and need frequent replacement, and their brief literature describes a ‘paper film\" of charcoal, not a bank of material. T would be surprised if the odor removed efficiency stayed at 80% for 1,000 hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim.

This effect my be: decreased friction (in- creased die increased extrusion speed; better surface appearance, > better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product i is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not persent. I'm sure there are trade’ offs among these several effects, and I'm also sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel ij source must be evaluated for the project at hand. The attached four pages of abstracts will give the reader a feeling for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960's and 70's | but originated in the late 50's.” I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.

Andree East Hill CITGO 301 Pinetree Road Ithaca, New York 14850 Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA) Dear Mr. Andree: Youhavecontacted usin regard to the legality of certain cigarette manufacturers’ promotions under the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA). ‘This letter is in response to that inquiry. As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-00 (2)M on March 3, 2000 stating that certain manufacturers’ promotional programs known as “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details It is the view that any change with regard to “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs would require statutory change by the Legislature. Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the manufacturer's invoice and “buy one, get one free” (or buy some, get some free) promotions. These programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction (including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer's invoice; (2) all cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer's brands in New-York State are allowed to participate in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to specified retail dealers (other than for purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has also offered manufacturer's coupons.

Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the manufacturer's invoice and “buy one, get one free” (or buy some, get some free) promotions. These programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction (including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer's invoice; (2) all cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer's brands in New-York State are allowed to participate in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to specified retail dealers (other than for purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product).

A more comprehensive report of findings is expected from the group moderator the week of September 15th. BACKGROUND . Research efforts to date have indicated that Virginia Slims smokers are perceived to be most like the desired perceptions of the M2 target (independent, self-confident, action-oriented) . The major deficit associated with Virginia Slims smokers is the perception of not being warm/friendly. This deficiency in a number of M2 target women perceiving Virginia Slims smokers.to be \"pushy, plastic, uncaring\". Initial creative efforts for M2 included a range of alternative executions from \"product-as-hero” to total imagery approaches. However, it was not known whether these executions projected the independence, self-confidence, active orientation desired by the target, while retaining the elements of warmth/friendli- ness. OBJECTIVES In order to be retained for further consideration as an M2 executional approach, test executions were to project the following: 1, Women shown in the ads must be perceived as independent, self-confident, action-oriented individuals who are also warm and friendly. 2. Executions must maintain some tie to the SALEM \"High Country\" ads, but be seen as different enough to communi- cate that M2 is a new brand. GROUP_COMPOSTTION Six group sessions were conducted among female smokers of 100mm menthol brands. ‘Two groups were comprised of Virginia Slims cnt 2 8",

I am convinced. from our work that a low antioxidant level in semen is a major risk factor for damage to sperm DNA and consequent birth defects and childhood cancer in offspring. Since smoking is a very efficient way to lower antioxidant levels, I expect that smoking will primarily damage sperm DNA through that mechanism. Our review of the epidemiology appears to bear this out. I enclose our Pittsburgh paper, where we make this case. We will continue this work to make the case as strong as we can. If smoking is only working through lowering then supplementation wih antioxdans should reverse ll of the deleterious effects on the next generation. I think this is extremely important to know and Iam committed to finding it out. If you wish to collaborate with us by collecting sperm samples from smokers and non-smokers in your company that would be very useful in speeding up the study as itis hard for us to find smokers locally. If you wish to add in a group of smokers of your presumptive safe cigarette to compare to regular smokers and non-smokers, we would be agreeable to that. ‘That might benefit you and would not be much extra work for us.

Ittermann RE: Moviegoer - CAMEL Perspective As requested, the following is Media's perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987. BACKGROUND Moviegoer was developed in 1982 by the 13-30 Corporation for exclusive use by the CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful Ampressions against better educated 18-34 year old males. Both Brand and Media management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization request submitted on May 7, 1981, which outlines key brand objectives. The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL's target not reached by other magazines, 2) generate Brand association/sponsorship ruboff and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment. A five-year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per year. In 1983, SALEM became a co-advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's budget. Rate increases have averaged 9% per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has remained controlled at 1.2MM per year. Moviegoer lias offered RJR a new three-year proposal (details attached). Briefly, the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be decreased from 12 to 10, the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5 g pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues). Circulation will increase 46% from 1.2MM to 1.75MM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM 8 or 150% for 2 issues). The number of markets will decrease from 127 to 100 (21%). ~ 2 RESEARCH During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer's readers. For purposes of this perspective, we will summarize key research datal Finding’ from these studies which we feel are relevant to our CAMEL perspective.

UNIVERSITY [DEPARTMENT OF FHYSIOLOGY + GILTNER HAIL EAST LANSING * MICHIGAN + 480261101 August 21, 1991 D ECGEIVE Dr. Harmon C, McAllister ) Research Director AD Of Couneil for Tobacco Research-U : 900 Third Avenue i NewYork, NY 10022 Dear Dr. McAllister: 7 The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology will sponsor the third FASEB Summer Research :Conference-on the \"Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Splanchnic Circulation\", which will be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado on July 26-31, 1992. This conference will tentatively have sessions on the following topies: Session I Chemical Modulators of Gastrointestinal Blood Flow Session IT Interactions Between Neural and Local Mechanisms of Vasoregulation Session III Molecular and Cellular Basis of Microvascular Functions Session IV The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury: Role of Blood Flow and Vascular Permeability Session V The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury: Role of Angiogenesis Session Role of the Circulation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Session VII_ Hepatic Circulation and Metabolism Session VIII Alcohol Effects on the Liver and G.I. Tract Session IX Portal Hypertension. The philosophy and goals of the meeting are unique. In addition to bringing together clinicians and basic scientists with interests in disorders of the splanchnic organs, the meeting will bring traditional investigators of the splanchnic circulation together with investigators using more cellular or molecular techniques. Thus, we hope to identify potential new research areas and to stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts. As the Conference Chairman, I would like to invite approximately 50 eminent investigators to speak at the meeting, and I want to encourage a number of promising young investigators to attend, by paying their expenses. Although both the American Gastroenterological Society and FASEB have endorsed the conference and have provided generous financial support, I still need about $15,000 to ensure that the meeting is a scientific success. The funds will be used exclusively for support of eminent clinical and basic science investigators’ meeting costs ($400) and travel expenses (between $400 for domestic and foreign participants). Any amount of funding your organization can contribute will be a great help. In addition, if any of the members of your organization would benefit from attending the conference, please bring the opportunity to their attention. .

Wagner ‘ SUBJECT: Project URP Weekly Status ; Central Laboratory Services representatives attended VRP status meetings 4/19 & 4/20. The meetings are summarized as follows: Paper R&D will address the need for a specification on Acetate im URP paper. Acetate 18 found in URP paper as a result of the bleaching process. The presence of Sodium Acetate causes a discrepancy the method Ecusta uses for Potassium Acetate and the method RJR GA and RJR R&D use. Ecusta's method for detection of Acetate reports both Potassium and Sodium Acetate 2s Potassium Acetate. QA is able to to test for and report Potassium Acetate, Sodium Acetate or Total Acetate. The Enecificetions as currently uritten only Potassiun Acetate levels. The April 12th shipment of VRP paper contained no but had signifigant anounts of Acetate. Visible Sidestrean Apparatus/Hessurenent The Visible Sidestream Apparatus is to be delivered to QA Operator treining and correlation testing will begin as soon as the apparatus is operational. R&D is to provide written test methods to QA prior to of test market product, The test market product will be jointly tested by R&D and QA. Both the 8S and 100 mm brand styles will be vith each lab testing helf of the senples. RED hes requested A assistance in neasuring visible sidestream smoke on prototypes. QA will provide assistance to R&D as provided on other analytical methods, t.e. QA will assist R&D with overflow prototype testing, provided the additional analyses will not put QA in an overtime situation.

Di Marco RE: Weekly Highlights - Biochemical/Biobehavioral Group Week Ending August 16, 1985 Scientific Affairs e@ Additives - Ms. Joyce Dickerson from Archer asked that we review the styrene/butadiene polymers used as moisture . barriers in cigarette packs. Dr. Deskin met with Mr. Don Murray and Mr. Elmer Marsh of Westvaco to define the information required for an assessment of potential product effects due to contact with tobacco. Most of this information must be supplied by the synthesizers who are major chemical companies. The Eastman Kodak representatives presented a seminar on a new filter additive which is supposed to reduce the tar to nicotine ratio. The additive is an unsaturated fatty acid which is added to the filter. @ Product Contamination - R&D will analyze contaminated tobacco for titanium. Before insurance claims can be processed, quantitative data must be gathered which determines the contamination level. The tobacco is currently being held in a bonded warehouse. The value of the tobacco is approximately 1.2 million dollars of both finished cigarettes and unprocessed tobacco. The improper type of paint was used which contained titanium dioxide. The type recommended by engineers was not used by the contractor.

I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for which support is sought. It should contain the following information: 1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status. 2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken, 3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Councii will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. It would also be helpful to have: 1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry. 2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided.

This document ie in response to your request for a “think piece” on how these two categories might develop in the next five years. In the document three separate scenarios are discussed. Each scenario differs in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories by 1988. These variations are supported by hypotheses regarding industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability, technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette consumers. Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of each scenario and the future development of the market. Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These recommendations address the need to: 1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves maximum lead-times. 2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige category. 3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions and competitive advantages.

KAMPE Re: Germany ~ Tax Classification It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report from the Customs Laboratory to the MOF. In a meeting this morning with three MOF officials, W. 7 Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and wore of the opinion that SPA’s characteristics were most similar to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the MOF to classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a cigarette tax rate. It was stated at the meeting that this report was preliminary and is not binding on the MOF. However, W. Dembach did not see any indication that the MOF would rule differently. The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance, Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich (the official directly in charge of RIR’s request). Absent from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s superior and has been an advocate of RJR’s position. wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a major factor in the MOF’s decision. Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He went on to say that the political issues of SPA’s investment value and social benefits were of no concern to the MOF in its interpretation of the law.

Genesis Packaging - TAC's retortable lidding structure is the material of choice at Genes{s, who requested 3MM square inches for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is confidential. Genesis and TAC management will meet during the second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production quantities early 1989, 2, Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting TAC 1/26-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500% permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88. Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen. 3. Campbell (Plastigon Program - Retortable Soups) - TAC's lidding material (utilizing a proprietary sealant film produced on the oriented film line at the pilot plant) has just passed U.S.D.A. protocol testing. Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant this week, The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new technology and markets. 4, Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with an offer of 2.0%, We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for $4MM of business and a 5,0% increase for $5MM of business. We expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by 1/29/88, 5. Converter Foil Pricing - Alcoa has announced a price increase of 6% effective on all new orders and on existing orders shipped after 4/18/88. We will support this increase and advise our customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and after 4/18/88, This action will also precipitate a general price increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing will determine the level and timing of this increase. a g 6.

        "text": ". RECEIVED CONPIDENTIAL JAN 28 1988. ~ 27, 1988 MEMORANDUM TO: J. T, Winebrenner [ SUBJECT: The Archer Company Activity Report for Week of January 25, 1988 | 1. Genesis Packaging - TAC's retortable lidding structure is the material of choice at Genes{s, who requested 3MM square inches for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is confidential. Genesis and TAC management will meet during the second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production quantities early 1989, 2, Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting TAC 1/26-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500% permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88. Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen. 3. Campbell (Plastigon Program - Retortable Soups) - TAC's lidding material (utilizing a proprietary sealant film produced on the oriented film line at the pilot plant) has just passed U.S.D.A. protocol testing. Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant this week, The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new technology and markets. 4, Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with an offer of 2.0%, We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for $4MM of business and a 5,0% increase for $5MM of business. We expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by 1/29/88, 5. Converter Foil Pricing - Alcoa has announced a price increase of 6% effective on all new orders and on existing orders shipped after 4/18/88. We will support this increase and advise our customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and after 4/18/88, This action will also precipitate a general price increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing will determine the level and timing of this increase. a g 6. TAC's Northeast Sales office has relocated from Long Island to a Wilton, Connecticut. Ralph Klein, Sales Manager, expects to have a ® secretary hired the week of 2/2/88, g 3 Jerzy W.",

Accordingly, SMINA'S emury tito the States (and Minnesota) cigar market will foster greater competition and offer adult of cigars additional products from which to choose. Section § cf No. 117, however, represents substantial barrier to SMNA's entry of the Minnesota cigar market, This section would require companies that scl cigars in Minucsota to submit annual reports which by brand, whether detectable levels of ammonia ot any compound of ammonia, arsenic, cadmium, formaldehyde or lead are present in thelr product in its ' ‘burned or unburned state. SMNA Goss not currently have in place any testing procedures to determine the presence: of these substances, I has never had a need to develop mch because no other country or state requires collection of this Moreover, the development of such testing procedures would take significant time. SMNA would nut be able to develop auch procedures prior to August 1, 1997 -- the date by which sellers of cigars in Minnesota must begin i ‘to collect data regarding and disclose the presence of the HF. No. 117 enumerated substances. Finally, even if a testing procedure could be developed in a timely inanner, the cost of testing over i 30 varieties of cigars both in a burned and unbumed state would be substantial. i} Faced with these problems, SMNA simply could not sel its cigars in the mate of i Minnesota.

Carlson Governor's Office 130 State Cepitol ‘St. Paul, MN 55155 Dear Governor Carlson: ‘Tam writing to you on behalf of Swedish Match North America Inc. (\"SMNA\") to express my company’s concern about particular aspects of HF. No. 117. By way of background, recently bogun to import cigars into tho United Our product line ie comprised of cigars in all price segments (from low priced to premium) and it is our intention to introduce over 30 varieties of cigars into the United States’ market. Accordingly, SMINA'S emury tito the States (and Minnesota) cigar market will foster greater competition and offer adult of cigars additional products from which to choose. Section § cf No. 117, however, represents substantial barrier to SMNA's entry of the Minnesota cigar market, This section would require companies that scl cigars in Minucsota to submit annual reports which by brand, whether detectable levels of ammonia ot any compound of ammonia, arsenic, cadmium, formaldehyde or lead are present in thelr product in its ' ‘burned or unburned state. SMNA Goss not currently have in place any testing procedures to determine the presence: of these substances, I has never had a need to develop mch because no other country or state requires collection of this Moreover, the development of such testing procedures would take significant time. SMNA would nut be able to develop auch procedures prior to August 1, 1997 -- the date by which sellers of cigars in Minnesota must begin i ‘to collect data regarding and disclose the presence of the HF. No. 117 enumerated substances. Finally, even if a testing procedure could be developed in a timely inanner, the cost of testing over i 30 varieties of cigars both in a burned and unbumed state would be substantial. i} Faced with these problems, SMNA simply could not sel its cigars in the mate of i Minnesota. Brsed upon SMNA't knowledge of the ‘United States cigar industry, anticipates that othor relatively omall cigar and importers would he forced to mike the same choice because HLF, No, 117's requirements would be 100 burdenzume.

Reynolds Tobacco Company as requested by the Commission on . April 13, 1983. We appreciate this opportunity to comment. 5 We urge as a first priority that the Commission immediately adopt a modification in methodology to adjust for the new variable introduced into cigarette and nicotine testing by “Barclay-type\" or filters. The Commission's inquiry into Une \"bypass\" filters has lasted long enough. It is time for. action and results. aC — R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has not yet . : finalized its position on Question 7, which raises broad questions concerning \"smoker compensation.\" In passing, however, two points should be made on this subject. First, no two smokers will smoke cigarettes in the same manner. In fact, the same smoker will : rarely smoke any two cigarettes in the same manner. Therefore, as the Commission itself has frequently : : noted, it is impossible to replicate human smoking in all its varieties. For the Commission to allow further delay in adjusting its methodology for \"by- pass\" filters while it attempts to resolve the myriad . questions related to \"compensation\" and human smoking would be unthinkable.

Original RSM Test (1976) - A feasibility test incorporating six key product variables and 27 test products to test the RSM methodology for application to our product testing (5 additional products were used to validate the results). 2. FF Non-Menthol Screening Test (1977) - A test incorporating 16 product variables and 20 test products to determine the relative importance of the product variables in terms of their effects on consumer product acceptability. 3. Improved WINSTON King RSM Test (1978) - A 45 blend RSM test incor- porating seven key product variables and ranges determined from the previous screening and RSM work designed to test against Marketing action standards for an improved product. All of the test products were tested on a paired basis through NFO among WINSTON, Marlboro, and Other NTF smokers. WINSTON King was used as the control product throughout in the 1976 and 1977 studies. In the current 1978 study, WINSTON King was the control product among WINSTON smokers and Marlboro was the control among Marlboro and Other NFF smokers. The results of these studies have been used to develop RSM models which include the effects of the seven key product variables on consumer product acceptability, tar level, nicotine level, and other laboratory measured variables. Approximately 85% of the variation in consumer preference is explained by the RSM model, indicating a good \"fit\" to the data. \\ In addition to having actual results of 97 product variations tested over a wide range, the RSM model can be used to \"simulate\" any number of products over the entire range of the variables studied in order to determine areas of product types which would meet the Marketing action standards. Over a half million products were simulated using the RSM model. The results indicate that less than 1% of these products would meet the action standards and, of those, about 90% fall into four narrow ranges of the variables tested. Table I, attached, lists the entire range of each variable tested along with the four areas of “potential” products which would meet action standards.",

These substrates; alumina, bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black (carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes should result in decreased carbon monoxide and decomposition products. Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021\" diameter wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8\" wide x 60 mm long. _ | 08S Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at a temperature near the boiling point.

Y. 10022 Dear Dr. I would like to clarify some aspects of the Research project which we submitted to the Council for Tobacco Research, in an attempt to demonstrate that our project is directly concerned with an area of cancer research which your organization is interested in supporting, i.e., the pathogenic mechanisms of oncogenesis and their control, as relates particularly to chemical carcinogenesis. We feel that the immune mechanisn is far more efficient in preventing the develop- ment of malignancies than in destroying well established growing tumors. The develop- ment of many tumors may indeed be considered, at least in part, as the result of failure of the cellular inmunity defense against tumor specific antigens. In these situations, either the least antigenic malignant cells may be permitted to grow and thus escape @ oF humoral antibodies may block specific celluler immunity. Considerable experimental evidence has been obtained in support of the considera- tions described above. As reported by ourselves and Dr. Old several years ago, it is relatively easy to demonstrate the increased resistance to tumor induction afforded by agents which stimulate the immune system, such as BOG but impossible to obtain favorable results with this type of treatment when the tumors are well established. Our purpose is to devise better methods of enhencing the immunological reactivity of host to weak tumor antigens and better techniques of stimulating selectively cellular immunity while depressing undesirable humoral immunity. Thus we plan to significantly decrease the rate of appearance of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens as well as increase the time after which they appear. We plan to use inbred mice for these studics rather than guinea pigs which we used for our studies on protection against leukemia because the mouse is clearly the animal of choice for these experiments. In addition, parallel with these studies in mice, the appearance of antibody against known viral oncogenic agents can be monitored in the sera of the experimental animals. We propose to use several inbred strains of mice, BALB/c, C57» C3H» and AKR and the following carcinogens, 3-methylcholenthrene and 3,4,-9,10-dibenzpyrene. We plan te paint or inject the carcinogen in graded doses to mice which will be subjected to various pro- cedures designed to affect the immune system and its reactivity, such as graft vs host reactions, treatment with certain bacterial extracts thet have demonstrable adjuvant efiects for cellular immunity. We will then observe the rate of appearance of the tumor in the population. In conjunction with these experiments, it seems important to us to develop a @ understanding of the mechanisms by which the inmune system manages to reject 50093420",

We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G, Gaston, attomey for D.D. Bean & Sons, Co, We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by your position, The distinctions cited in your leter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA. As we previously explained, matchbooks are within the meaning of section IIKf) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are not written or electronic Publications, Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(9. Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section TIIG) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use .. any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself” 3 g a 2 3",

We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G, Gaston, attomey for D.D.

As we previously explained, matchbooks are within the meaning of section IIKf) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are not written or electronic Publications, Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(9. Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section TIIG) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use .. any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself” 3 g a 2 3",

We have found that racemization occurs at the elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous report. It Ts now clear that the yleld obtained by thls approach is very Jow and would be of the order of which makes the method impractical for prepartng large amounts of d-Nicotine, We are there- fore evaluating lower temperature (e.g, 170°C). The chemical synthesis of racemic nicotine looks promtsing and may be the best solution. How- ever, untt] the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to complete the study. [t appears that we have liquidated the world's supply of cyclopropylbromide!! We have Investigated the McKennis synthesis method of POBA and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an alternative we are looking at the reaction of with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of these studies will be discussed in our next report. Sincerely, Andrew M.

This letter . given below Des Jr Gives ‘the position of this matter Dear Howard as of September, 7, 1962. HHB. Many thanks for your letter of 30 August. I have been so busy of late that I have neglected writing my very best friends, most trusted associates, and loyal Beardians. Like the prophet, Abdullah, you head the list. ‘One filing about sixty days ago was made with the Federal Food and Drug Administration, This consisted of about nineteen pages and could be considered a memorandum of information, Notice has been received that this filing is incomplete. I have prepared another fil- ing that will amount to almost 400 pages, and I trust that this filing will be considered complete. The statutory limit for notification on a filing is sixty days, as you know; however, in some cases noti- fication is given earlier than this. You can advise your physician friends that a new drug application of almost 400 pages has been made to the Federal Food and Drug Admin- istration and that a similar filing will be made with the corresponding California agency within the next few days. I want to thank you for your intense and continuing efforts in the cause of Beardianism. I appreciate very much what you say about the pressure you are receiving from doctors, since we are feeling a bit of this ourselves. As I may have told you, Doctor M.W. McDougall of 529 East 10th Street, Long Beach, California, is working on the Beard Anthrone Test. Perhaps you would like to drop him a line to welcome him to the club. Cordially yours, Quy KA y Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. JOHN BEARD MEMORIAL FOUNDATION",

F, Dube The results of a blind product test of fresh aftertaste (FAT) products were reported on 11/5/87. The management summary provided by MDD is included as an attachment. The products utilized the recently developed controlled release pellet technology with a low level of menthol. These products had measured smoke menthol deliveries of less than 6.5 ug/puff as compared to approx. 70 ug/puff for Salem Lt. and approx. 45 ug/puff for Newport. Three low menthol level products were tested, in which pellets containing 3%, 5% and 7% menthol by weight were inserted in the filter. No menthol was added via conventional means (i.e. top dressing, filter flavor). Products were tested among 18 - 49 year old non-menthol Full Flavor and Full Flavor Low Tar smokers, male and female. In the FF category, all three products were rated inferior on 870+ acceptance. All three products increased menthol, minty and artificial taste attributes. As we've seen repeatedly in qualitative work, FF non-menthol smokers will not accept a product if they can detect menthol. Further corroboration is provided by an earlier 1987 Concept/Product Test in which non-menthol smokers were given a concept, stating that \"a hint of menthol” was used in the products. These products were overwhelmingly rejected. In the FFLT category, the 5% menthol product was rated parity among total category and superior among 18 - 24 year old smokers and among smokers with a high fresh aftertaste ideal. The 3¢ and 78 menthol products were rated inferior to the Control among FFLT products with the 3¢ level apparently too low and the 78 level too high. For the 5% product, tobacco taste, strength and harshness attributes were maintained while fresh aftertaste and cooling aftertaste were increased. Increases in mildness, menthol, minty and artificial taste were also noticed; however, this category did not view these attributes negatively as evidenced by the positive acceptance scores. These test results are highly encouraging in view of the fact that the suspected target category for a new product with fresh aftertaste is FFLT, young adult female smokers. Additionally, the 5% menthol pellet product wes parity among category indicating that its performance was comparable to existing brands. However, it did have the aftertaste improvement a vehicle which should enhance acceptance in the FFLT category. We expect to have a product with this technology on the market within the next 12 months. s",

Heflin RE: WINSTON Packaging Focus Group This forwards for your review the Brand's perspective on the WINSTON packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12, Background The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive suokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle, Focus groups had been held previously (March 25, 26) in Atlanta to identify ownable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or refined. With this direction, KNT Plusmark developed new packaging designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that were tested in Tampa, The information fron these latest groups will be utilized by Brand to provide further direction in the development of a design for quantitative testing and test market introduction in 1/88. Methodology Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held: @ Male WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old Female WINSTON suokers, 35 - 49 years old ¢ Female Marlboro smokers, 21 - 34 years old © Male Marlboro smokers, 21 - 27 years old e Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 34 years old Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new designs were very close to current packaging, while one \"further out\" design vas shown to see how large a change was acceptable. One set of packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor, except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red. Implications Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise groups reacted very favorably to the new designs. In fact, more radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the franchise groups, The bottom line seems to be that WINSTON’s franchise is essentially apathetic to thedr packaging. As aptly a expressed by one participant: \"WINSTON would still be WINSTON to $3 me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag.” The major Pi concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition: they © want to be able to quickly recognize and pick up their WINSTONS, 8 | 8",

Relman -- Editor-in-chief New England Journal of Medicine 10 Shattuck Street Boston, MA 02115-6094 Dear Dr. Relman: I have enclosed two copies of a manuscript entitled \"A Cigarette That Heats Rather than Burns Tobacco: Chemical and Biological Studies\" by J. D. deBethizy, M. F. Borgerding, D. J. Doolittle, 3. H. Robinson, K. T. McManus, C. A. Rahn, R. A. Davis, G. T. Burger, J. H. Reynolds and A. W. Hayes that we would like you to consider for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. The manuscript has been approved by all of the authors. Our manuscript describes a series of studies which evaluated the smoke chemistry and biological activity of a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco which was developed by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The significant findings reported were large reductions in the yields of many chemicals from the new cigarette and that these reductions were associated with a reduction in urine mutagenicity in smokers. A recent editorial by Dr. Neal A. Benowitz that appeared in the June 15, 1989 issue of the Journal called for a \"worldwide attempt to reduce the yields of toxic substances and to make the yield of all cigarettes as low as possible. Our studies demonstrate that a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco can achieve substantial reductions in the yields of many compounds. The manuscript has been reviewed by Dr. Peter Dews from Harvard Medical School, Dr. Robert Neal from Vanderbilt and Dr. Martin Cline from the UCLA School of Medicine. All three reviewers felt that the studies described in this manuscript would be of great interest to the vast majority of medical professionals.

Cromer Stites & Harbison 400 West Market Street Suite 1800 Louisville, Kentucky 40202 Re: Billboards Dear Messrs. Freedman & Cromer: Thank you for your correspondence of March 3 and March 5, 1999, providing additional information about your Ohio billboards so we could proceed with our alternative advertising plans pursuant to MSA SIII(4). As I informed you yesterday by telephone, Ohio will proceed with placement of alternative advertising on all available billboards, and to the extent any. billboards are no longer available, Ohio will accept suitable and comparable substitute space of equivalent value. Jane Kilgore of our Public Affairs staff has carefully reviewed the several lists you provided and communicated directly with each of the outdoor advertising firms that own or sell the space. Attached is the list of billboards we have compiled for placement of Ohio's altemative advertising program. In most instances, the billboards are those you listed, and we have confirmed availability with the vendor. In those instances ‘where the billboards were no longer available, we have arranged for substitute space of equivalent value. Any such billboards are included in the attached list. For example, Cleveland Outdoor Advertising informed us that the 14x48 billboard at W. 117 and I-90 ‘State Office Tower / 30 East Broad Street / Columbus, Ohio 43215-3428 ‘An Equal Employer nm Pana 283100863, PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE",

Wagener, M.D. 21 July 1992 Associate Professor of Pediatrics University of Colorado Medical School Advisor, Coalition on Smoking OR Health and Asthma Education Technical Advisory Group American Lung Association Introduction Nearly 10,000,000 children less than five years of age living Inthe United States are exposed involuntarily to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at e Twenty-five percent of pregnant women continue to smoke throughout their pregnancy. Although the overall rate of smoking In U.S. society has been decreasing during the two and one-half decades since the Surgeon General's report on the adverse effects of tobacco, the exposure risk to young children, particularly those living in low income or black families, remains at 50-60 percent. Involuntary exposure to ETS atfects children in three different ways. First, pre- natal exposure potentially can have a marked impact on total body development including lung, brain, and size development. Additionally, premature delivery and spontaneous abortion are related to maternal smoking. Second, post-natally the growing child may have effects of ETS which impact on the heart, lungs, immune system, ears, brain, and even survival itself. Third, and possibly most important, childhood exposure to ETS impacts on the child's decision to engage in active smoking and other self-injurious medical behaviors 2 which most likely will continue into adulthood and will compound the effects of perinatal ETS exposure. : Non-Respiratory Effects The potentially injurious effects of ETS on a child's health are both non- respiratory and respiratory. Although the recently described correlation between ETS and blood cholesterol in children is significant 9, the non-respiratory effect that may be o e@ most important is the relationship between ETS and sudden infant death syndromes - 3 or SIDS - because mortality from SIDS during childhood is potentially preventibie. 5 3 The Universite of Colores isan equal opportunity action emploner",

Lyerly Machine Shop Research Department Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred. The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be essentially silicon dioxide (sand). During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 731RTV had been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. 1 recommend that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result. ‘in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided. Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation.

Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most conventional measure of association, Product-moment lation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively. Pearson's r isbased on the product moments for each data point e@ represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted ‘sun of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore requires interval scals measuring the variables. In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points on the scales. Only tio points are represented for each variable (e.g. high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack). A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F. Schuessler, Statistical Reasoning in Sociology, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1961, pp 242-249. Sincerely, Richard J.
