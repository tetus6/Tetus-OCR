As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/ cigarette-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette technology sooner than originally projected. In essence, this approach could provide incremental to our current products while minimizing the risks associated with a wholesale change.

The attribute ratings identified problems with strength, odor and performance that Could be correlated to decline in acceptance.

The evaluations included the measurement of Overall Acceptance and 16 attributes related to performance, usage, flavor, strength, and odor (ballot is attached). The subjects also provided written comments. The 31 subjects who evaluated the test product for two weeks, completed three evaluations (Groups Si and The twelve subjects who evaluated the product for 39 days, completed five evaluations(S3 Group). The data were analyzed for ail subjects of Groups Si, 52 and $3 for three intervals. The subjects in Group S3 who provided five evaluations were also analyzed Separately. The results of the first two intervals have been reported previously. Results of Three Intervals for All Subjects Test conditions varied for the three groups of subjects. The Si and S2 Groups were both on the diet but smoked the product during different two week periods. Males and females were represented in both groups. The $3 Group was not on the diet and smoked the product for 39 days. The S3 Group was comprised of males only. The results were analyzed for group and interval effects.

Your question about caffeine or nicotene is interesting to me because both seem to stimulate physiological processes at low levels. I did begin one draft of my review with the assertion that most people are familiar with the hormetic effects of caffeine, nicotene and ethanol, but somehow it seemed a little trite! I felt that to remain credible I ought to keep the examples I gave close to my own field of interest, so the review and my other papers on hormesis deal only with growth. I have not yet found examples in the literature of growth hormesis with caffeine or nicotene. ‘In recent months we have been trying to see whether the explanations for growth hormesis in hydroids (reprint enclosed) applies to other organisms. T have suggested that hormesis is due to regulatory over-corrections of a rate-sensitive feedback mechanism that controls growth in hydroids, We have been seeking evidence for a similar explanation in a marine input and have shown that it oscillates in the same suggestive way, but in the experiments thus far the extent.of the growth stimlation is not statistically significant. Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis. With best wishes. Yours sincerely, Oey Stebbing Enc. 019341"

Quantitative Positioning Concept Test W/O 9/23 7 Results WO 11/18 The Quantitative Positioning Concept Test will be used to determine optimm positioning, smoker segment, business potential and aroma categories which support the positioning. For the quantitative concept test, products will be required to demonstrate the odor benefits, although these products will not be smoked by the - ‘consumer. Une bor? In order to provide these products, decisions mst be made on which aroma categories appropriately address consumer wants and match the positioning concepts. The Marketing suggestion was that internal screening, prior qualitative learning and \"best judgment” be used to arbitrarily select the aroma categories. It would be unwise to make such decisions based on such fragile evidence. It is the opinion of the SA Team that in-depth marketing research be conducted. Such research should answer certain basic questions: 1. How do consumers categorize odors/aromas? 7 2. Which of these aromas have positive connotations? 3. of these aromas are tobacco/smoke compatible? 4. How many segnents exist with different odor preference (i.e, male, female, 35+, FF, FFLT, ULT, ete.)? 5. Is there a universally acceptable aroma which 1s not seguent specific? 6. Are aroma/odor concerns of smokers and non-smokers the sane? Is this issue of greater importance to one of these groups? Are their preferences alike or different? 7. Within an aroma category, there is a wide breath of odorants, Which of these inter-category odorants best address the problem, are preferable to the consumer, mitigate the concern? 2"

Kabat Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine Albert Einstein College of Medicine Belfer Building Rm. 1302 1300 Mortis Park Avenue Bronx, NY 10461-1601 Dear Dr. Kabat: I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL. Amn, J. Epidemiol, 142(2):141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely indicates a minor error. Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in childhood as 0.90 for (Le., any exposure), 1.12 for “I smoker in the household,” and 1.13 smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the R's for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is, unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe, be incorrect. Tealeulated crude OR’s and Cl’s from your published case and control counts for each exposure category and was surprised to find thatthe crude results for “yes/no” identically replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142 that “{u}nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2 contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state ifthe results in Table 2 are, or are not, adjusted, My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household” vwas 0.93 (95% Cl: 0.42-2.06) and for “2+ smokers in the houschold” was 0.87 (95% Cl: 0,31-2.45). These calculated crude sub-category results are logically consistent with the e published, dichotomous “yes/no” results. 3 : g : 3 : 8 : “tie work for smokers"

Chilcote, Jr. ho, Enclosed for your review prior to our conference call November 16 are The Institute staff's recommendations for 1993 creative and media buys for the \"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No\" and “It's the Law\" print campaigns. These materials include a narrative describing the rationale for the proposed insertion schedule, the new creative work, and the budget. As with all program materials, our audience is adults. By way of summary: wpobacco: Helping Youth say No\" Three different creative concepts are included in the 1993 \"tobacco: Helping Youth Say No\" print advertising package (Tab 2). The first, \"It's Tough Growing Up,\" complements the print messages for 1991 and 1992, and continues to dovetail the themes stressed by the television PSAs. This ad has been designed for placement in general consumer books and minority publications, at 2 budget totaling $694,000 for general consumer (down $256,000 from 1992) and $85,000 for minority media (down $10,000). A second ad, \"Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up,\" has been designed for decision maker publications and continues to promote both the youth and \"It's the Law\" components of the youth initiatives. The 1993 budget for decision maker publications is at $291,000 (up $66,000 from 1992). the third ad, also headlined \"Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up,\" is designed for the education trade press and is the same ad that began running midway through 1992. Because the educator audience is the peer group of the Family COURSE Consortium members, the Consortium is designated as the sponsor of this ad, made possible by a grant from The Institute. This sponsorship again dovetails the designation carried by the PSAs. full-year schedule for the education press is budgeted at 8 $25,000 (a $5,000 increase). a"

Finn State Office Building St. Paul MN 55155 Dear Senator Finn: Solving our health care insurance problems are going to require far more difficult solutions than simply making Minnesota’s tobacco tax the highest in the nation at the expense of Minnesota’s businesses. If Governor Carlson’s proposal goes through, one group of businesses and consumers will bear the burden of paying for a necessary and vital program. My only question to you is this: what happens when those customers go elsewhere to buy their tobacco and the state doesn’t collect the’ amount of money it needs to finance this program? Where will the money come from next? Who is going to make the decision on who gets coverage and who doesn’t when the money runs out? Customers of Minnesota businesses and most importantly their employees should not be the ones who have to pay the price because Governor Carlson and some legislators think raising tobacco taxes solves the problem of affordable and accessible health care. We don’t need gimmicks; we need leadership. Sincerely, Edwarde, Darla Edwards RT 2 Box 274 Nevis, MN 56467 TIMN 458860"

We wish to thank you again for your financial ‘contribution of last year that helped make the 1991 meeting a great success.. For this coming fall, we are organizing a symposium on Molecular Signalling and Cell Structure. Understanding the molecular and structural basis for the transmission of regulatory information from membrane to nucleus is among the central contemporary issues in molecular oncology and cell biology, and this symposium should help fo coalesce emerging ideas on the topic. se hom Participants include Thomas Pollard Hopkins), Thomas Stossel (Brigham and Women’s Hospital), Timothy Springer (Rockefeller University), Thomas Leto (NIH), Colin Hopkins (MRC, England), and Inder Verma (Salk Institute). The topies to be discussed range from on cell structure and growth factor receptors to the analysis of gene expression. We feel that this conference is particularly timely and will help to focus on new ideas regarding cell-cell interactions, cell structure and cell signalling. Given the nature of the topic and the outstanding quality ofthe scientific participants, we expect this symposium to be a major event in this rapidly developing field. We are writing to ask your financial support for this symposium, Funds willbe sed to partially offset the costs of travel and local expenses of the speakers. We would, of course acknowledge your inthe program and in any advertisements for the Symposium which ae prepared subsequent to receiving a commitment from you.

We withdrew fom Motor Trend about a month ago. The reason for & WILLIAMSON's withdrawal from Motor Trend was that the corporation had no back cover franchises. Related to our not having back cover franchises, we felt that the publication's back-up policy of requiring only one inside page for each back cover may be to the detriment of BROWN & WILLIAMSON. Motor Trend is the most efficient measured magazine for both KOOL and VICEROY. If it were not for our dispute with the pub- lication regarding back cover positions for B&W, we certainly would not have withdrawn from the publication. The publication has offered us one back cover in 1974 (July is- sue). In addition, they have offered first option on another back cover. The Representative (Mr. Dick Opfer) also has indica~ ted that he will try to secure more back covers. The July back cover would ke in trade for one of our existing inside covers. At the time we exercise the option on the additional back cover, it would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers. til we exercise that option, we do not have to give up the inside © covers. Although this offer from Motor Trend does not address itself to the publication's back-up policy, Mr. Opfer has indicated that o the back-up policy is due for further examination by Peterson management. However, he feels it is quite unlikely that a change in the back-up policy would be implemented in the very near future. The net result of the various meetings with Peterson is that BROWN & WILLIAMSON has gained one back cover franchise and a first option on another back cover franchise. We believe it is reasonable seek a little more. 660015463, PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

Smith, Ph.D. It is with great pleasure that we announce Dr. Carr Smith’s promotion to Senior Staff Scientist in Research & Development. Carr has been with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company since 1986, performing a variety of critical functions for the Company. He has been in the Product Evaluation Group since November 1992. Over the past eighteen months, his work in meeting the objectives of the Product Evaluation Group, formerly the Biological Research Group, has been exemplary. We are pleased to recognize Carr's efforts with this promotion. One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the challenge to build this program and has made significant progress to reach his goal, He has carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company. These articles are being submitted for publication in Peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts. Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientific rigor to the question of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Carr was actively involved in responding to the EPA and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientific facts, In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and responsibilities of a Senior Staff Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted to have him as part of our team. We look forward to his continuing efforts to provide balance in scientific discussions of the biological activity of tobacco smoke, particularly in the area of cardiovascular disease.

Dickerson I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-1OP, scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The product, which is being mailed for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining consumer test data ona \"no-nicotine\" protocept. The LNA-10V product has a . blend nicotine of 0.118 and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette. Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05-0.06% in Merit Free and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to 0.06 in Merit Free and Next. The low nicotine in LNA-10V was obtained through conventional denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-10P product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In theory, the LNA-10P approach will give approximately the same nicotine value as the LNA-10V approach, using tobacco blends in inventory. If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water extraction is being changed significantly. Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to producing material for one consumer test. I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-10P until we have done a more thorough job of process and formulation development. Dickerson g By 8 xe: Mr. D. R. Pugh Mr. W. M.

Sensabaugh, Jr. Project No.: 2394 Project Title: NL Sumary: Regular and menthol NL-type cigarettes have been developed and submitted to Marketing for their evaluation. These cigarettes were designed to deliver 17 mg. \"tar\" and .15 mg. of nicotine. Various blends, top-dressings, and processing changes were evaluated to reduce the off taste and off aroma associated with the M-2000 process for nicotine removal. Although some reduction of the off taste and off arona have been accomplished by renoving the burley tobacco from the blend, changing from freon to pentane, modifying M-2000 processing conditions, and improved top-dressing, a definite off taste and off sidestream aroma in the smoke is still present, The off flavor and undesirable sidestream aroma are apparently inherent to the M-2000 process. Future work on this project will depend upon Marketing's recommendations after evaluating the products that have been submitted. Memorandum: Initial testing of various types and grades of tobacco showed that the M-2000 process did change the smoking characteristics of the tobaccos. The processing is more detrimental to burley tobacco than flue-cured tobacco in that the level of off taste and off aroma are greater. Evaluations of various grades of tobacco were N-2000 processed showed the stronger grades reduced in strength and having smoking characteristics closer to the milder grades. All grades evaluated had a distinct M-2000 taste and aroma, All these observations were made using tobaccos processed in the freon system. Initial evaluations of WINSTON-type NL cigarettes versus a WINSTON “Control” showed the WINSTON \"Control\" numerically favored in flavor and preference with the NL significantly milder. These results are shown in Table I. TABLE I - WINSTON \"Control\" versus WINSTON NL ‘L-7415-A ‘L-7415-B \"Control\" NL NLD.

The following advantages and disadvantages are apparent from this proposition: Advantages © Introducing AA as a menthol would give a separate reason for being to both AA and MG.

Perfetti Flavor Division, PA&T Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter Sheet Material The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaC03. (Sample'G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to 30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal- ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 + 2985 ig/cigarette, i.e. 4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 ig/cigarette) and silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066 ug silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS. The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaC03 present in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash 599%. The amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette. As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G). jomas A.

Each application is reviewed by members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists who serve as our peer review committee. Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forme: The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. We ask that you complete the enclosed \"Current and Pending Support\" form since some consideration is given to your current funding level.

These bills are concerned with federal requirements for cigarette labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Gommereé for consideration, At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, composed of the health of each state and cach territory of the United States, passed a recom- mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard the state health depaztments and the United States Public Health Service need to develop comprehensive programs to help to bring under control the habit of cigarette smoking. A copy of the Association recommendation is In view of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientilic evidence shows that are in truth a health hazard, we would like to be on record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in'S. 559 or S. 547. We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative factor, such as cancer lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so important today that people who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by continual cigarette smoking, We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its position clearly understood and strengthened as far as labeling and advertieing is concerned. Whether this needs specific wording as to advertising asin $47 or simply leaves the Federal Trade Commission free to propose and undertake such control as it wishes under its existing authority is A matter about « Stich vee do not (eel sufficiently to comment at this time, except fe say that the opinion of the Federal Trade regarding the adve 2° and their ability to administer it should be given adeh weight, : — ea 8 | :"

Ford The Council for Tobacco Research 900 Third Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022 U.S.A. Dear Don: It was lovely to talk to you on the phone. As I have said to you my outlook of life is now different. May I please request an extension without further funding of our grant entitled \"Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human Lung Disease\" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Haretield Hospital, and Mr. John Wallwork from Papworth Hospital, both groups of which are involved in heart lung transplants. @ have done sutficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their localisation in tissue sections. These include, in vitro autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding and In situ hybridisatton/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike earlier days when avaflability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we would very much like to «rite up an exciting extension grant application to the best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new field of investigative pathology. I very much hope this will not cause too much inconvenience to the Council for Tobacco Research and I look forward to hearing from you. Best personal regards, @ susie ose mo FRoPath.

These tests were performed August 3-11 in Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette, PHASE 111 All examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits for this product. (Attachment 1) ‘SPOTTING/STAINING were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Mch.#10) contained 27 spots and the test (Nch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again at 30 days and at 90 days. CONTAMINATION TESTING/SIEVE ANALYSIS i Fifteen random samples of Netpmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8% plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totale of 19 and 11 found in sim{lar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive, In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately 19% higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and therefore is less objectionable. Steve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36% pass the 14 mesh. (attachment 2) Samples have also been collected from product using 6% plasticizer and three center glue lines. Results from this analysis should be available by August 23. There are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 68 plasticizer filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting & next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are o favorable, RJRTI R&D will approve use of the Neipmann for TI brands."

MeCarthy Se N The recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the improved flavor components waich were reviewed for the BRIGHT filter flavor system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step for- ward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor systen which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor sys- tem, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the fil- ter. Arevised flavor system with only peppermint hearts in the filter would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilemma of not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products. In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently under- way, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement work in 1984. Please advise if there are any questions or concerns. oz Z tdch 7 xe: Mr. B. V. Hardin Mr. Willara Mr. Phillips Ms. M. M. Wong . Ms. B. J. Dula Dr. B. M. Lawrence Ms. G. C. Smith 5 8 8 2 $ 8"

    "text": ". RJR R&D Statistical Support InterOffice Memorandum SUBJECT: Visible Sidestream Smoke Measurement DATE: January 24, 1985 TO: Joe Inman FROM: Michael J. Morton Brand R&D INTRODUCTION Sidestrean smoke measurenents were teken on 52 products: 11 prototype Products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurenente were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures reported were visible absorbance values. Each number reported is the average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the sidestream smoke measures. Forty-five products were measured on one device and the renaining 7 were measured on the other. Sone products, a monitor and NOH 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance. The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the 11 prototype Products give off less visible sidestrean smoke than all of the 41 comer- cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurenent devices end the visible sidestrean smoke values for all products in the study were compared. I will first describe the results of a comparison between the two measure- | ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that wes made enong the 52 products. DEVICE COMPARISON 4n analysis of variance on the two measurenent devices shoved en average difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines. (The newer machine read about .0178 lover than the original machine.) That difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two machines, but it is not significant at the standard level. The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigerettes that were used to monitor the machines. The difference was .0185 units for the so-called Monitor (which had an average absorbance of about .75) and -0170 units for NOW 85 (which hed an average absorbance of about .54). o In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assun- ing that the to devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis- 4 ‘tinguisheble from the other products is not changed according to which es- sumption is made."
