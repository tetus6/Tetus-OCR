WASHINGTON, 0. 20006 202/487-4800 10: Editors and writers on women's subjects Because the tobacco and health controversy has increasingly focused on women and smoking, I am enclosing the latese Tobacco Institute publication which addresses this issue. I hope you will find a way to make your readers aware of ics contents and its availability, free of charge, from The Tobacco Insticute. Whether it be the issue of women and smoking, or any of the other controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products, we sincerely believe that a full, free and informed discussion of the issues is in the public's best interest. We agree with the American Cancer Society's conviction that, \"adult individuals must make up their own minds about smoking but, ic requires thac individuals know the facts.” For too long, adversaries of tobacco have attempted to influence those adult personal decisions, as well as public policy, with assumptions, opinions or conjectures not supported by scientizic or medical tact. FACT OR FANCY? was produced to present more factual, and balanced, answers on the health question about which mature women need to know more. If we may provide any further information to you or your readers, please contact me. I have included our toll-free telephone number for the use of anyone desiring additional inforaation or a copy of this publication. Additionally, please consider The Tobacco Institute as a ref- erence source the next time you have occasion co write about any aspect of the tobacco industry or the controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products.

As you know, the SP-A gene is expressed in a lung-specific manner; SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type I pneumonocytes and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found in studies using transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA flanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A gene targets reporter gene expression only in lung, and specifically to type II and Clara cells, In consideration of the cell-specific nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also express gp330. I read your grant proposal with great interest and believe that your studies using loxP/Cre Tecombinanse-mediated gene targeting for creating cell-specific inactivation of gp330 will yield important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.

Hashim Associate Research Director ob ‘The Council for Tobacco Research - USA, Inc. 900 Third Avenue ugh New York, NY 10022 Dear Dr. Hashim: this'year; an international conference on Research.will be Institute & Conference Center, located jt Albany,-New York, This will be the fifteenth in the series of Albany-Conferences.organized-by-the Nucleic Acid Technologies Foundation, in conjunction with several area academic and scientific institutions. As you can see from the enclosed flyer for this year's meeting, the topic is a very timely one. There has been a burst of interest in recent years on mitochondrial invelyement in normal cell function and in disease. Mitochondrial defects are being implicated in a host of neurological, muscular, and metabolic disorders (including diabetes). In addition, considerable interest is starting to focus on mitochondria as targets for a wide range of drugs, including benzodiazepines, immunosuppressants, channel blockers, and nucleoside analogs. Because of the renewed interest in this \"old\" organelle, the meeting is attracting a distinguished group of front-line researchers to present their latest work. ‘The reputation and visibility of the Albany Conference series have grown with each meeting over the past 11 years. However, as with ail ventures of this type, we rely heavily on outside sponsors to help underwrite some of the expenses. Each year we have been fortunate to receive significant support from private organizations such as yours, who have a vested interest in promoting biomedical research, The Albany Conferences are unique in many ways, including their intimate nature and inter- disciplinary focus. The audiences have been savvy and appreciative of the chance to exchange ideas in the environment we provide. We make every effort to let them know which companies have helped to make each meeting possible. This is a request that you consider helping us make the 1996 Albany Conference on Frontiers of Mitochondrial Research a success with your sponsorship. We are seeking contributions in the range of $500 to $5,000. Higher level contributions carry perks such as single-toom accommodations for scientific representatives (registration fee waived) and full-page sponsor acknowledgements in the meeting program (design of your choosing but no product advertising). Certainly, we would also be pleased to receive smaller contributions, all of which will be recognized at the meeting and in the final program. 70015348"

Zahn RCH SUBJECT: American Heart Association Miami, Nov. 17-20, 1980 ‘The AHA's annual session has become one of the largest med- ical meetings in the world. This session had about 1400 pre- sentations and a huge display of drug companies and equipment manufacturers. The size and complexity of the event prompted the association's program committee chairman, in a speech on \"Science and Advertising,\" to point out certain aspects that he said were adversely affecting the organization. He specif- ically criticized drug companies that sponsored their own sem- inars and special events at various hotels to promote certain drugs, and he even took a general swipe at scientists who en- gage in ‘advertising\" to promote their own findings or hypo- theses with insufficient data. The press, which was well represented, discussed thie in terms of washing dirty linen, but wrote nothing about it. Nor did the writers express other than casual interest in the sev— eral reports dealing with various aspects of smoking or the press conferences that. contained the usual antismoking comments. It is likely that the heart association will increase its antismoking activities in 1981 because of its new president, James Schoenberger of Chicago. ‘The highlights: 41. \"Induction of cholecystitis and pneumonitis by inhala- tion of cigarette smoke constituents\" -- Larry Dillon, New York. This was another report from Carl Becker's group at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (Becker co-chaired the session at which Dillon spoke) on the alleged allergic and other ef- fects of smoking. Becker had previously reported experimental induction of inflammation of the gallbladder, and Dillon elaborated in his report. He described details of an experiment involving anes~ thetized dogs inhaled tar-derived material (TDM) and 7, serving as controls, inhaled a phosphate buffered saline solu- tion. The TDM was in the form of a powder derived from the aqueous extraction of cigarette smoke condensate. Four of the TDM-exposed animals and two of the controls had their gall- bladders exposed surgically at the start of the experiment. TDM exposure lasted 60 minutes; blood samples were taken from the ‘ 3 coms Vy and Associates nc. = (©. 0. 223) 19 ROAD + GREAT NECK, NY. 11021 + (212) 895.7445 2"

Hence, they did not feel, ready to encourage you to give notice to present members of your staff who might be needed for further projects in future. In order to provide time for you to conclude your present work, for and planning conferences on future programs, ‘they agreed to continue support to your program at substantially the current level to a termination date of January 1, 1969. Meanwhile, the Board indicated a willingness to consider work other than the present project if you can advise them of a project of interest to both you and the Board. If you are ready with any such proposal by August 1, 1968, it can be considered at the September lth meeting of the Board, ‘The next meeting thereafter will be on an undetermined date in December with a deadline on Noveuber 1st. As you know, certain steps are being undertaken in the hope of perfecting the equipment for chronic exposure of small animals to whole, fresh, normal cigarette smoke and of developing a better method for measuring the actual exposure of lung surfaces, especially to particulate material, While it is hoped that these goals may be reached quickly, there is an element of uncertainty as to when every~ thing will be considered ready for resuming animal inhalation studies ona large scale. Meanwhile, however, plans can be laid, feasibility studies may be practicable and perhaps studies of inhalation or of gas-phase constituents may be possible, and studies of cells dr culture-could: be-continued.—There-are -virus~problens — requiring attention and some of these might be emphasized during the interim,"

Reynolds, IV FROM: Patricia F. Perfetti I would appreciate consideration by you and the HRRC of the following proposal to request consumers to smoke Vantage Excel 100 and one test VRP prototype Prepared with cigarette wrappers containing low levels of boron. Background: Vantage Excel 100 entered test market January 31, 1989. Although consumers are very enthusiastic about the taste and product concept, numerous written and verbal complaints have been received by RIRT regarding the \"messy, fly-away nature of the ash\". It is paramount that the ash be improved immediately to insure the success of the brand. Two prototypes (described below) have been prepared with modified VRP low sidestream paper with the intent of improving ash cohesiveness.

The SAB continues to roll along, but your wisdom and humor were always admired. Now, I need the wisdom especially. It is possible that at some time in the future there may be some legal action which would touch CTR. We need someone of stature who would be willing to plainly state the facts, i.e., that the research supported by CTR over the years was never influenced by our sponsors and that the award of funds for biomedical research were made with total objectivity by the SAB. No one is better qualified to do this than you are. Frankly, this matter may never come up. The first anticipated possibility of needing such testimony is some two or three years in the future. However, our lawyers do want to know whom they might call upon, and I hope you will agree to do this. Needless to say, you would be reimbursed for your time and expenses in connection with anything of this sort. If you feel that you would be able to help me, I would appreciate it if you would send along a copy of your current curriculum vitae and bibliography. I will in turn pass them along to our attorneys. I hope that you and Lou are doing well and I send my warmest personal regards always. Thanks and all best wishes. Sincerely, a F. Glenn, M.D. 7"

Ettenburgh Scotland, United Kingdom: Dear Dr. Chisholm Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support., I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal. To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief preliminary outline (3 to 4 pages total) of the study for which support.is sought. It should contain the following information: 1, A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status. 2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken. 3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for « maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. It would also be helpful to have: 1, Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators, The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry. 2, One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May.31 and November 30; activation is typically seven months later. Sincerely, Harmon McAllister Enel HCM/mla"

Over the Christmas holidays we ran into some serious computer hardware problems which resulted in our falling behind schedule by approximately one week.

Thus we are behind our original target by two weeks and, therefore, I would Tike to revise the deadline for submission of the Final Report to January 31st. Since the manuscripts are in tandem and will be generated from the Final Report Data Base, the completion date for the two manuscripts would be rescheduled to March 31st.

We mean what we say about our commitment to honest scientific research to help answer the questions about tobacco, and would welcome your opinions. I can assure no amount of carelessness about the facts, for which some of the anti-tobacco forces are responsible, is going to put us off course in seeking the truth, which is the only way to resolve the continuing smoking and health controversy. We hope that our industry's voluntary discontinuation of broadcast cigarette advertising, as formalized by the Congress to be effective January 2, will help to provide 7 = a climate beginning in 1971 for the kind of objective approach to the tobacco question which the public deserves.

Toohey, Jr. : The Tobacco Institute 1875 I Street, NW : Washington, D.C. 20006 Dear Bill: The perspective (and follow-up) afforded by a week seems sufficient for reporting, though not finally, on the results of our effort last Tuesday at the National Press Club and the announcement of “Helping Youth Decide.\" The event was, as you know, preceded by a week-long period of > \"background briefings\" with key media. The coverage based upone;. these briefings, the event itself and follow-up fall into two broad categories. These are Print and Electronic. On the print side, we have verified the following: The Lowell (Massachusetts) Sun ran the story. Copy to come. The reporter was Tom Squitieri. Gannett News Service -- serving 86 newspapers in 37 states -- ran the piece. The reporter was Pat Ordovensky. Scripps-Howard -~ serving over 60 newspapers out of the Washington bureau -- filed the story. Ken Eskey is the reporter. A copy of this one has already been forwarded to your attention. USA Today ran with the story on the day of the event. As you know from my backtracking, the eventual three-line item which appeared in the National News section that day was culled from a larger, more comprehensive piece done for the Life section by reporter Barbara Zigli. The piece was deemed more national than lifestyle news by the Life section editors and it was shipped to National where it was snipped by Julia Wallace who is a national news editor. No follow-up by USA Today is planned, although Life editor Linda Kauss wants to see updates on program acceptance, usage, etc. (more) TINY 0011257 PLRUC CONMANCATONS Power House BG 200073654 Te 2333740 TW 7106229202 GRAY CO WH"
