As you know, the SP-A gene is expressed in a lung-specific manner; SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type I pneumonocytes and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found in studies using transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA flanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A gene targets reporter gene expression only in lung, and specifically to type II and Clara cells, In consideration of the cell-specific nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also express gp330. I read your grant proposal with great interest and believe that your studies using loxP/Cre Tecombinanse-mediated gene targeting for creating cell-specific inactivation of gp330 will yield important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.

There has been a burst of interest in recent years on mitochondrial invelyement in normal cell function and in disease. Mitochondrial defects are being implicated in a host of neurological, muscular, and metabolic disorders (including diabetes). In addition, considerable interest is starting to focus on mitochondria as targets for a wide range of drugs, including benzodiazepines, immunosuppressants, channel blockers, and nucleoside analogs.

Piehl ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF | Ve WORK HORSE - Employee Mail panelists preferred a WORK HORSE control over i ‘a modified WORK HORSE with the prune concentrate reduced 50%. The control was directionally preferred for longer lasting flavor. This test was con- i ducted to determine if the natural prune concentrate could be reduced significantly in the event of a crop failure. i / « Water Solubles Analysis of G-7 - Levele of extract were varied to determine i ‘the correlation between water solubles in G-7 and filling value. Correla- tion curves which can be used to predict the increase in filling value as extract levels decrease are now available. At this time, lowering the water solubles content of G-7 to increase filling value and thereby reduce costs | does not appear to be feasible due to the lack of availability of the addi- tional stems’and scrap required to make G-7 with less water solubles. However, the possibility of eliminating the G-9 dust extract as a means of improving G-7 uniformity and quality is under investigation. aa Ss New Packaging Manager - Mr: Jim Joy, currently Manager of Corporate Quality Packaging at Kellogg, has been hired as Program Manager for New Packaging Development.

Piehl ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF | Ve WORK HORSE - Employee Mail panelists preferred a WORK HORSE control over i ‘a modified WORK HORSE with the prune concentrate reduced 50%. The control was directionally preferred for longer lasting flavor. This test was con- i ducted to determine if the natural prune concentrate could be reduced significantly in the event of a crop failure. i / « Water Solubles Analysis of G-7 - Levele of extract were varied to determine i ‘the correlation between water solubles in G-7 and filling value. Correla- tion curves which can be used to predict the increase in filling value as extract levels decrease are now available. At this time, lowering the water solubles content of G-7 to increase filling value and thereby reduce costs | does not appear to be feasible due to the lack of availability of the addi- tional stems’and scrap required to make G-7 with less water solubles. However, the possibility of eliminating the G-9 dust extract as a means of improving G-7 uniformity and quality is under investigation. aa Ss New Packaging Manager - Mr: Jim Joy, currently Manager of Corporate Quality Packaging at Kellogg, has been hired as Program Manager for New Packaging Development.

Hence, they did not feel, ready to encourage you to give notice to present members of your staff who might be needed for further projects in future. In order to provide time for you to conclude your present work, for and planning conferences on future programs, ‘they agreed to continue support to your program at substantially the current level to a termination date of January 1, 1969. Meanwhile, the Board indicated a willingness to consider work other than the present project if you can advise them of a project of interest to both you and the Board. If you are ready with any such proposal by August 1, 1968, it can be considered at the September lth meeting of the Board, ‘The next meeting thereafter will be on an undetermined date in December with a deadline on Noveuber 1st. As you know, certain steps are being undertaken in the hope of perfecting the equipment for chronic exposure of small animals to whole, fresh, normal cigarette smoke and of developing a better method for measuring the actual exposure of lung surfaces, especially to particulate material, While it is hoped that these goals may be reached quickly, there is an element of uncertainty as to when every~ thing will be considered ready for resuming animal inhalation studies ona large scale. Meanwhile, however, plans can be laid, feasibility studies may be practicable and perhaps studies of inhalation or of gas-phase constituents may be possible, and studies of cells dr culture-could: be-continued.—There-are -virus~problens — requiring attention and some of these might be emphasized during the interim,",

Employees are being exposed to these chemicals in the workplace. Dr. John Kirschman will publish a paper on “Investigations of dichloromethane metabolism and subchronic oral toxicity as the basis for design of chronic oral studies in rats and mice\" in the November issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology. An FDA Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity to Food Constituents has recommended an increase in research efforts in the area of antigen characterization and the development of an appropriate animal model, a reporting procedure for deaths due to adverse food reactions to the Centers for Disease Control, an increase in enforcement of good manufacturing practices to prevent laws which exempt some ingredients from food labels, and an increase in educational efforts toward physicians, consumers and manufacturers regarding avoidance and treatment of food reactions. The recommendations also included the labeling of bulk foods sold in retail outlets and to limit or phase-in the release of new food additives. The committee also acknowledged the incidence of food reactions to legumes which included peanuts and soybeans, seafood (accounts for 5 to 10% of reactions in children), milk and eggs (10 to 25% of reactions in children, 0.1% in the general population), w tree nuts and chocolate. The committee also noted that & reactions to grain products are exceedingly rare and there is = 5 no evidence that molds/yeasts produce adverse reactions. | 7",

Background: Vantage Excel 100 entered test market January 31, 1989. Although consumers are very enthusiastic about the taste and product concept, numerous written and verbal complaints have been received by RIRT regarding the \"messy, fly-away nature of the ash\". It is paramount that the ash be improved immediately to insure the success of the brand. Two prototypes (described below) have been prepared with modified VRP low sidestream paper with the intent of improving ash cohesiveness. Need For Human Subjects: Unbiased human subjects are required in order to determine if the ash improvements demonstrated by either prototype are significant enough to be noticed by the typical Scientific Affaire Review: Memorandum attached (Rhenda Steele to Pat Perfetti, March 10, 1989). The conclusion is that boric acid and sodium tetraborate decahydrate are approved for further review by the HRRC.

It is possible that at some time in the future there may be some legal action which would touch CTR. We need someone of stature who would be willing to plainly state the facts, i.e., that the research supported by CTR over the years was never influenced by our sponsors and that the award of funds for biomedical research were made with total objectivity by the SAB. No one is better qualified to do this than you are. Frankly, this matter may never come up. The first anticipated possibility of needing such testimony is some two or three years in the future. However, our lawyers do want to know whom they might call upon, and I hope you will agree to do this. Needless to say, you would be reimbursed for your time and expenses in connection with anything of this sort. If you feel that you would be able to help me, I would appreciate it if you would send along a copy of your current curriculum vitae and bibliography. I will in turn pass them along to our attorneys.

Ettenburgh Scotland, United Kingdom: Dear Dr. Chisholm Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support., I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal. To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief preliminary outline (3 to 4 pages total) of the study for which support.is sought. It should contain the following information: 1, A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status. 2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken. 3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for « maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. It would also be helpful to have: 1, Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators, The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry. 2, One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May.31 and November 30; activation is typically seven months later. Sincerely, Harmon McAllister Enel HCM/mla",
