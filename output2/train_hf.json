Pearson RE: Noviegoer Meeting March 16 This will report on our meeting with Christ Whittle at which 13-30 presented an update and stewartship report in response to my letter of February 28. 13-30 appears to be delivering the staffing and services required by the contract or spelled out in the original 1981 proposal. In those cases where there are exceptions, they seem to have a reasonable explanation. The following is a brief summary on each area covered: | Field Staffing | Internal and field staffing equals or exceeds that outlined in the original proposal. While sone of the internal and field staffing also | Spend tine on other 13-30 properties, it seems that overall the | original requirenents are being met. One significant change involves the substitution of full-time service reps in place of part-time service people.

Circulation by Market A summary of circulation by market is attached. We also have theatre detail by market available, This circulation has not changed significantly over the past 2 years. Market Analysis of Annual Reader Poll Reader response polls, conducted via insert cards, were part of the original plan.

The table attached, prepared by Laura Amshoff, provides us with information we haven't had before. In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic within those sales departments where the spring flight will run. It also confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonego (Department Manager) has already, on his own initiative, worked with me to develop plans for improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana out through Quad cities. While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consumers can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores. PKG's nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging the distribution gaps where they do exist. Sincerely, Michael McCue F. E. McKeown J. Heneveld--PKG R. A.

Needless to say, I did not absorb every nuance, but the overall impact of the document is very positive. First of all, I am impressed with the meticulous nature of your studies and the exemplary way in which they are presented. Obviously your peer review committee felt the same way. Next, the product of itself is impressive. I was astonished when I saw it \"in action\" at our meeting with you, and now the analysis of the concept and the construction is equally impressive. Finally, you have done a very good thing in producing this document.’ It should help the new product gain public as well as scientific acceptance. There would seem to be little doubt that you are on the right track. When I have absorbed a little more from the volume, I will pass it around the office so that all can see this. I am enclosing a summary of the neuroendocrine effects of nicotine, prepared by Dr. Don Ford of our staff here at CTR. Don is a neuroanatomist, who has a long-standing interest in nicotine effects, and he has prepared an excellent summary which might be of interest to Bob DiMarco or some of the menbers of his staff.

Potter The technical analysis of the new Marlboro 25's product. and packaging is complete with the exception of a thorough blend analysis of Marlboro Light 25's, which will be completed on July 13, 1984, Attached are the results of our analysis with this one exception. We provide here a summary of the attached results for your review: The blend analysis on Marlboro King Size 25's showed no significant difference compared to Marlboro 20's product. analyzed earlier this year. No difference was found in the tow item, cigarette circumference or percent air dilution. The difference in tip draft and cigarette draft 1s due to the high variation noted in the samples tested and is not thought to be an intentional change. The physical and analytical data collected for the Marlboro Light 20's and 25's products indicates there is no difference between these two products. This cannot be confirmed until the blend analysis 1s complete on July 13. The major differences between the Marlboro 20's and 25's products are in the packaging. Besides the obvious differences caused by placing 25 cigarettes in a pack and eight packs in a carton, raw material differences were noted. The Marlboro 25's products utilize a 45 1b. base paper in their foil inner liner versus the 28 1b. Liner found in the 20's pack, a 65 1b. C18 litho label in place of 55 1b. and .O1H inch carton stock in place of .012 inch. Although these upgraded packaging materials may offer some additional packaging stability with rounder less sharp edges on the pack, they may also cause an upcharge in the total packaging cost. This upeharge includes the estimated savings resulting from reduced material requirement. Preliminary packaging cost analysis indicates a minimum 3% upcharge before purchased volume considerations are taken into account which would significantly impact on the cost of printed items, The follow-up report will be issued as soon as the Light g blend analyses are completed, 8 8 a"

J. Reynolds are gathering pertinent information that we believe will assist NIP in its determination. That information will be forwarded to you shortly by them. In the meantime, as you may know, federal district court recently vacated the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency's Report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that sought to classify ETS as a known human carcinogen. I enclose a copy of the court's opinion for your review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS. . The opinion begins by discussing the procedures Congress had established for EPA to follow in its research program on indoor air quality. The court concluded that EPA fell short of complying with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether, “aside from procedural defects” (page 38), EPA conducted the risk assessment in 4, , with the Radon Act. . The‘core scientific requirements of the Radon Research Act are 8 identified as “[g]athering all relevant information, researching, and disseminating findings” {page 90) atid providing “clear, objective information about indoor air quality” (page 91). The court found that EPA's goal was to name ETS a Group A carcinogen, rather than to conduct an 8 objective scientific review. ES “We work for smokers.”"

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW This should be limited to a maximum of one-half hour presentation. Areas may overlap with Ralph Angiuoli’s. Nevertheless, efforts should be made to over simplify. Wherever possible, data should be presented in diagrammatic form rather e@ than tables (e.g., bar charts, graphs, pie charts were relevant). A. Show industry decline over last ten years. Project out for next three. Indicate major events which have influenced the decline (e.g., FET increase, etc.). B. Illustrate main segment performance. Segments here should be limited to simple product segments and consumer demographic segments (e.g., size, flavor, box versus soft, men and women, and age groups) . Show each company’s performance (by share of market) over the last ten years and projecting out over the next three. D. Draw simple profile of each company in terms of individual brand portfolios (with individual shares). Suggest we limit to top three brands in each case with all others combined. Indicate company areas of strength and weakness in terms of areas of growth. Refer these where relevant to market dynamics such as segment performance. if B) Indicate each company’s spepging, both in total and by major 2 brand (top three only plus all others combined) . 3 @) Profile each company in business terms (e.g., ownership, profitability, sha tobacco art of total earnings, @ other businesses ana tg activities, etc.)."

Resce Extended Puff Count, Lower CO Delivery And Improved Conductive Heat Transfer In TGA Modele Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally Conductive Aluminum Summary The conduction-of heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA model back to the substrate (and tobacco) via an aluminun macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum “fingers” which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend the Leagth of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering ite combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate Of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is at a slower rate, and (2) the production of CO via reduction of CO, is decreased because of the lower temperature maintained in thé burning coal. Background Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum nacrocapsule. The fuel source is generally inserted only 1 or 2 Ga inside the The heat must travel from the burning fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the 1 to 2 um to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol = delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the a interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, @ new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel ~ source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where the fuel source is inserted into the capsule but also along these eee"

First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget authorized. Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the Company’s Sales Representatives in the field.

Walker Chairman of the Board Gentlemen: I doubt {£ this letter will get to the Chairman of the Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As as Kennedys can keep this as a whipping boy, they will con- tinue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal gain and not the public. I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health, paregoric which can be bought at eny drug fountain in small quan- tities, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers association and different farm organizations busy on this, because . it is not going to end until someone makes it politically unprofit- . able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an issue of it. I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of deal- ings with the medical profession, and how in the Hell ehey can say that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cancer is, is beyond me, but at any rate, it is a popular subject, I remember twenty years ago, when if a person had a bellyache he was automatic- ally operated on for appendicitis, and that fad has blown over with 8 the medical profession.

Re: Toplines of Menthol Date: July 18, 1988 Study: Interleaved vs. Direct Application The Menthol Developmental Group is exploring the direct application of menthol onto the carbon sheet as an alternative to the current interleaving process (1). The level of menthol migration to the fuel source is one of the criteria by uhich this decision will be made. The Shelf Life Group assisted by evaluating and comparing menthol tien to the fuel sources of products incorporating the Interleaving vs. “the direct Application processes. Procedure: Cartons of Alpha products 8040A (Interleaved) and 80408 (Direct) were exposed to 78 F and 120 F conditions for five days. Menthol determinations of all components were made at 0, 1, 3, and § days. An informal sensory test ues perforned at Day. S- Results and Discussion: As shoun in I., results from this study suggested menthol migration to the fuel source 1s greater for products incorporating the interleaving vs. direct application processes when these products are exposed to either 75 F 75 F or 120 F conditions. However, it is knoun that the base sheet used to make 8040 had a lever carbon activity than the sheet used to make earlier successful prototypes, 8002C and 80128. In order to achieve a similar menthol load as the tobacco paper plug plug used in these prototypes, 4 days of interleaving were required (vs. for B040A... This resulted in excessive free menthol which would be available for migration and possibly bias the results of this test of direct ve. interleaving processes.

Reynolds Tobacco Company 401 North Main Street Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102 For the past seven years I have run a successful sampling program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up-scale adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels and clubs. I was informed today that the hotel sampling program will not be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There have been recent competitive developments which lead me to believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988. The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900 or nineteen-cents a pack, not including the cost of product. This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces has far-reaching sales potential. Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris who has held this program on-line since 1970. We consistently run into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here - in this important market. Indeed we have held a preemptive position versus the competition because we sample seven days a week. Yesterday, for the first time, we encountered Lorillard at the Sheraton-Center Hotel sampling “Newports\" at the International a Hospitality Ball. 3° 3 3 3 - 8"

Importantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address MarIboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against snokers likely to switch out of the franchise. ‘This strategy is to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR primerdly concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity segments. Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise. Opportunity = Convert Opportunity = Maintain Marlboro Franchise > Older Adult Smokers Younger Adult > RIR Brands Franchise Smokers With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning, for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.

    "text": "ah 2 TIAL CeO d January 30, AM a TO: Mr. £. J. Fackelman FROM: W. R. Penick SUBJECT: MARC INBOUND 800# COST REDUCTION IMPACT MARC’s toll-free cost reduction will impact two of our operational areas: Smoker Recruitment and Product Research. Savings in the 1991 Product Research projects would have totaled $180,000 with MARC’s new toll-free cost. This represents an 8% reduction in their total fieldwork costs. For the smoker recruitment area, the savings are negligible as MARC’s new rate is slightly lower than what we were paying in 1991; and the use of the toll-free operation has been increased significantly with changes in our recruitment document design. Coincidentally, but unrelated to MARC’s inbound cost reduction, Tracker is reducing the cost we were paying for the diary panel recruitment tag-on. This cost reduction will provide a $235m cost avoidance in 1992 and is explained below. $46m was spent with TRACKER in ‘91 for diary panel recruitment. On a cost/complete basis, this cost was more than what we paid MARC for smoker recruiting through SRMS. When questioned about this discrepancy, MARC attributed this cost difference to the different markups each group in MARC used. MARC has standardized this markup, and the price was reduced to $23m. . Instead of reducing the cost of Tracker by $23m, we asked TRACKER to use this money to recruit as many smokers as possible due to the low cost/complete with the new price. This has resulted in doubling the number of smokers recruited. . We also made a procedural change in how these smokers are used. Instead of putting these smokers directly into the diary panel, the smokers will now be placed in the SRMS and allocated where they can provide the greatest benefit. For example, an 18-24 year old Marlboro smoker to a CAMEL product test. This will allow us to maximize savings for the company ($235m estimated in 1992) through the most efficient allocation of resources. If you have any further questions, please call. 20 W. R.

D.Phillips Several staff members in R&D have obtained information which is applicable to the development of low-sidestream cigarettes, I have prepared two low-sidestream prototypes, one with information by Dr. J. L. Harris and the other with Harris! information combined with the use of “carbonized” filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal smoking suggests that these Prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating sidestream aroma which ie common to the current CC~prototypes. Dr. Harris has (RSDM, 1982, No. 50; CIM, 1980, No. 27; CIM, 1977, No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without Ca00, filler resulte in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries.” The major is that due to the reduced suolder rate, the puff count 16 extraordinarily high (~20-25 puff/eig). He suggested that unusual . configurations are required to obtain cigarettes with reasonable deliveries and puff counte. Prototype DET~111682-B was prepared with CaCO,-free cigarette paper (supplied by and 27.5am long non air-diluted filters made vith 2,9/44,000 tow. NOW 100 blend (high G-13 level) vas used in an effort to reduce the puff count to acceptable levels. The results of smoke analyses are Presented in Table 1. It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS substantial reductions (~50%) in measured sidestream were achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were obtained. Prototype DET~111682-A was similar to that described above except that the filler included 30% “carbonized” flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. White), Mr, White hae that the use of “carbonized” filler in a blend results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The resulte of smoke analyses for this prototype are also presented in Table 1. A comparison of samples A and B shows that the use of “carbonized” filler resulted in further eidestrean ‘tar’ reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as only an upper limit, however. Dr. Harris has demonstrated that the routine method for measurement of sidestream ‘tar’ is in error for cigarettes which contain “carbonized” filler, The actual ‘tar’ delivery is somewhat less than that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS ‘tar' from cigarettes with “carbonized” filler. Thus, all we can say at this point ie that the sidestream 'tar' reduction is in excess of ~60%. ‘The results of visible sidestreem measurenents are unavailable at this time due to the load and priority of CC-prototypes. However, it 1s clear that 3 the visible sidestreem is very low. 3 FORM 1770 ."

Definition of Terms . : Draft is the resistance to the flow of air. A standard flow rate is used _ ~ measure the resistance which recorded in either inches or milli- “meters (mm) of water. The higher the resistance, the higher the number of the measurement. Firmness is a measure of the softness of a cigarette tobacco rod. The measurement is applying a standard force for a standard period of time to the tobacco rod and measuring the depression in 0.1 mm. dnerements. Therefore, 0.1 mm. of depression is called 1.0 units of firmness. The higher the the softer the cigarette.” Smoke Analyses are obtained by placing the cigarette’ in a special holder, Lighting the tobacco rod and pulling air.(35 ml) for two seconds once per minute. This constitutes a \"puff\". The cigarette 1s puffed as specified above until the fire cone or burning zone reaches a line 3 mm. from the filter tipping. : Puff Count is the average number of puffs required for all of the cigarettes the analytical procedure to reach the specified 3 mm. distance fron the tipping paper. . . | Nicotine is the pharmacologically active alkaloid ingredient in tobacco smoke, and is collected on a special filter during the smoking procedure. The nicotine 1s reported separately from other smoke components. Tar 4s all the solid and Liquid materials in smoke except nicotine, which is reported separately, and water, which is subtracted, to obtain weight of tar per cigarette, pH 4s a measure of the acid to base ratio. A value below 7 1s acid and a value above 7 is basic. . Implications of Measurements Upon Consumer Perception . Draft: Typical cigarette draft is about 2.4 to 4.5 inches. Too low a draft . would make it difficult for the smoker to pull air through the fire cone and generate smoke, Too high a cigarette draft would make the smoker . have difficulty pulling the smoke through the rod, e.g. the Strickman . filter. : : . = 8 . 3"

    "text": "& Mather Letter to the Editor of Personnel Administrator DRAFT pete To the Editor: As the owner of a company with about 100 employees, I found Lewis Solmon's recent article, “The other side of the smoking worker controversy,\" interesting. I'd like to share my own views, since I've had some experience with the issue. A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers. When they first approached me I considered the situation but, for several reasons, decided against any restrictions. First, implementing smoking policies would have required that I take action against good employees who have worked for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since, as in many offices, employces with similar skills and responsi- bilities work together. Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis- covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither aware of nor particularly interested in the problem. I have not read any of Weis’ articles to which Solmon referred nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggests that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing re- strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me money. Sincerely, . TIOK 0027645"

Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses, several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists who serve as our peer review committee. Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two or three years) in'a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forms. The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. Complete scientific freedom is assured and our only expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals. Sincerely, - (eich eee Arthur D. Eisenberg \\ A"

Background ‘The WINSTON 100's Improved Product program was initiated in February, 1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. ‘The primary reason for WINSTON's lack of preference was its being perceived \"too strong/harsh” \"less smooth/mild\" relative to Marlboro. Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's, It was intended that one of the products would be introduced into an “announced” test market if it met the required action standards, which have since been modified. The new \"announcement\" action standards specify: * Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers. * Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers. {Additional element) * parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers. (Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H) * preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers. * preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target for the 100mm NFF category. * ‘TPM at 17 mgs or less. Test Results 8 Blend 42 demonstrated significant advantages over current 1100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards for “announcement” test market.

In accordance with the terms of our letter of agreement dated Jamu- ary 23, 1981, and your letter dated December 28, 1961, in which it was agreed that displays could be cancelled on thirty (30) days no- tice, please accept this as our request to cancel the H.B. display. We will pay rental on this display through May 15, 1983, and ask that you remove it at that time. We may be able to use the lightbox at another location at a later ate, and would like to have it shipped back to this office. If you can arrange to ship it to us by U.P.S., we will be pleased to reimburse you for any packing and shipping costs.

Cundari Jeanne Swisher Jim Best Dave Owens Wayne Tucker Jack Geeting Dave Wilmesher Rick Young Casey's General Stores After many months of negotiations, we finally have a contract signed with Casey's. As you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with P.M. and BAT; however, shortly after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they needed us on contract as well. ‘The current backbar setup for cigaretles (see pictures attached) is 8’ long and 8.4’ high. P.M. has 4' or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per month. BAT has the top portion of the other 4’ section or 25%, and has maximized their payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of 8’ from the counter to the backbar, our space is all very visible. ‘The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4° section with them. This just didn't make good business sense. Ifyou have any questions, please feel free to contact me. g 8 Sincerely, = Don F. Knoll Account Executive"

Anti-tobacco groups are intensifying their efforts to achieve a \"smoke-free society,” and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state legis- are Finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a stand on our behalf. If we are to improve the legislative climate, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco must increase its involvement in the political process. We must continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RJR Political Action Committee is the best means available for our company to financially support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly. However, for a variety of reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to meet our increasing needs. The RJR PAC deserves your most serious consideration and attention. Parti- cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved, but any officer who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J. Reynolds Tobacco’s future by supporting the PAC fails to recognize the importance of the challenges we face in the political process. Enclosed is a menbership form and a return envelope for the RJR PAC. The suggested contribution rate for the RUR PAC is .6% -- recognizing that officers are also asked to contribute .4% to The Tobacco Institute PAC for a total of 1% gross salary. Payroll withholding is, of course, the preferred nethod of participation in the PAC. A contribution form for TIPAC will be sent to you after the first of the year. 1 am confident that all RURT officers will join me in supporting the PAC. If you are already contributing, but at Jess than the suggested rate, I encourage you to consider increasing your leve? of support. Sincerely, a James W. Johnston y a a"

The bottom line isin the entire retail universe within the Kansas City Division should reflect Doral $.05 less a pack/S.50 less a carton vs. branded competitive sets. 4). Relative to the pricing survey issues, adjustments will be made which will reflect on strategy if Doral is $.50 less a less a pack vs. branded competitive sets. 5) The additional part-time labor request (32 hours a week) is still under consideration. Will advise ‘when decision has been made. | Sincerely, R.D. Garrison aa cc: Chartie Davis | ‘Steve Qualkinbush ; Joa Bishop $ Mark Donnelly"

I have followed your advice and have outlined the research projects being in- vestigated in my laboratory. I trust this information will be considered by the Scientific Advisory Board, and I lock forward to their decision. 1. Background ~ We are investigating the biological and biochemical aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan et al., 1978). In the last year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated that the EHV-] and EHV-2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart, bone, and CNS); the EHV-3 transformed cells have been inoculated into hamsters within the last two weeks. In the case of the EHV-1 system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines harbor viral DNA sequences (3-20% of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/cell). Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages) passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors), and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by 1) demon- and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence. Presently, blot hybridization analyses are being carried out in which individual restriction endonuclease fragments (labeled to high specific activity by nick translation) 50222862"

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that cigarettes containing nicotine fall clearly within the definition of \"drugs\" which \"are articles intended to affect the function of the body of man.\" In addition, the evidence against such cigarettes as a dangerous health hazard, both to the smokers themselves and to non-smokers unavoidably exposed to a smoky environment, is overwhelming - far stronger, in fact, than any evidence yet revealed against saccharin, which is already acknowledged to be under your jurisdiction and concerning which you have already taken definitive action. Your prompt regulation of cigarettes containing nicotine can be a giant step toward saving untold numbers of U.S. residents, now living and as yet unborn, from illness and premature death due to lung cancer, heart disease and other human ailments already linked to cigarette smoking. incerel: Shen EB.

Littell Senior Director - Operational Support Sports Marketing 5A PLB | Dear Greg: I am sure you recognize the extent to which our future success depends on decisions made by elected officials in Washington and the state capitals. Anti-tobacco groups are intensifying their efforts to achieve a \"smoke-free society,\" and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state legislatures are finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a stand on our behalf. If we are to improve the legislative climate, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco must dramatically increase its involvement in the political process. We must continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RUR Political Action Committee is the only means available for our company to financially support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly. However, for a variety of |reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to meet our increasing needs. The RUR PAC deserves your most serious consideration and attention. Parti- cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved, but any management employee who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J. Reynolds Tobacco’s future by supporting the PAC fails to recognize the importance of the challenges we face in the political process. Enclosed is a membership form and a return envelope. The suggested contri- bution rate is .5% of gross salary, and payroll withholding is the preferred method of participation. 1 am confident that you will join me in supporting the PAC. If you are already contributing, but lat less than the suggested rate, I encourage you to consider increasing your level of support. Sinceyely, Lin a 3 Janes W.

Retail performance of most companies was also stable month-to-month. ~ Full Price performance was in line with expectations.

Outlook: - We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national ‘workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we'll continue to be impacted by the same competitive factors that contributed in April Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases. + Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to show litle, if any, impact from the PM product recall MAJOR UPCOMING PROJECTS/REPORTS TIMING MARLIN Topline - May 6/26 Monthly Business Overview 2 é Penny $, Cohen BUSINESS INFORMATION & ANALYSIS a PSC:dh"

    "text": "December 22, 1986 TO: J. A. Herberger FROM: D. W. Shouse RE: 1987 Federal Excise Tax Increase This provides a program recommendation to manage the impact of a potential excise tax increase effective October 1, 1987. I. Overview Consideration will be given in the 100th Congress to increasing the Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes in 1987. RJR Public Affairs predicts that if an increase is in fact legislated, there is a 70% probability it would take effect October 1, 1987, and a 30% probability it would be effective July 1, 1987, In either case, the most likely increase will be either 8¢ or 10¢ per pack. Depending on the timing and magnitude of an increase, Industry volume is expected to decline 2.9% to 3.8¢ as a result. These declines are incremental to the forecast industry baseline trend (-1.7%). RJRT volume is estimated to experience a commensurate decline with total Industry. This estimate is based on the fact that RIRT currently has its fair share, or 32.3% of the Savings Segment. Consequently, RJRT is expected to maintain share. While RJRT volume should not decline disproportionately versus the total Industry, it is expected that a significant shift in Pull Price vs. Savings Brand volume mix will occur. For example, under an 8¢ increase effective 10/1/87 scenario, RJR Full Price volume is projected to decline about 1.7 billion and Savings volume projected to increase by .4 billion. The shift in mix is more demonstrative for the full year 1988 Price volume is down over 10 billion units with Savings volume up almost 5 billion. II. 1987 Volume/Profit Impact Volume and profit impact of an FET increase and recommended =, action plan assume an 8¢ increase effective October 1, 1987, 9 since this scenario appears to be most likely. Sensitivity $ analyses of other possible scenarios are included as appendixes. e RIR volume is projected to decline 1,347MM units in 1987 as a result of an FE? increase with losses on full-price brands offsetting gains on DORAL and CENTURY.

Here is one item we wanted to discuss: Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan. I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with Hogshead. H.J. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday. As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. J. were going to propose that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings display, alongside Doral, They would not benefit from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success. According to R.P., I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as another footprint. At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and switch it out with existing RIR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a month instead of Doral, and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc. ‘© That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do, i.e, fall partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock more conventional approach. = ‘We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart, I just wanted 3 you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation, 8"

Jones Listed below are key long-term and short-term factors that have impeded SALEM’s ability to achieve Nielsen share objectives and volume for 1988 and, moreover, will also affect any projections pertaining to 1989. I. Long Term 1) Continued growth of Savings Seqment - SALEM particularly vulnerable due to franchise profile - Represents a source of high switching losses for SALEM 2) Continued decline of 18 - 34 year old target smokers among both General Market and Black Market smokers ~ Losses of \"quits\" are not being offset by gains from \"new\" which places longer-term downward pressure on SALEM’s share trend TI. Short Term 1) Increased competitive price/promotion pressure - Higher Savings Segment pressure including probable expansion of Alpine in 1988 and 1989 - Proliferation of menthol line extensions g = New strategy by B&W to place market support behind volume for Kool, typically a major a contributor to SALEN switching gains 2 8 . 8"

Does it relate to a national introduction plan or is it too expensive ... that is the question that is always asked, Ifyou think about it, the cost of one billboard on the NJ turnpike could totally fund the Green Team activities for possibly a full quarter. In the next few days, we will be sending you (if you have green zones) the information on manual tracking of purchases in selected green zone stores. This is the only good way to get a read on our business. It will require our SR/TR’s to call on approximately 5 to 7 stores each week to gather sales/purchase data from invoices. Once the stores show that they understand what information we need on a weekly basis, we can then use Retail Representatives and possibly green team members to gather the information on a weekly basis. ‘There is no other and due to the tremendous importance of this Salem test ‘ona national basis, we need to approach this project with a “Positive Attitude”!

I have been very pleased with the results from the cytotoxicity and micronuclei assays completed with the funds used to date and look forward to initial results investigating the in vitro smoke exposure system with the remaining funds. I am hopeful that any results obtained with HiQ using your in vitro smoke exposure system would benefit our continued collaboration on refining this promising technology for in vitro smoke exposure.

Bowman-Gray Technical Center Reynolds Blvd. Winston-Salem, NC 27105 Dear Mike, Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities. Summary of Activities SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS ~~ Priority #1 Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering. Oxide additives such as Nay and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness. EIBERGLAS INSULATOR REPLACEMENT MATERIAL ~- Priority #2 g Calcium sulfate whiskers from US Gypsum (Franklin Fiber) are the most $ 1 & 2 3"

The objective of this development pathway has been to reduce the smoke nicotine yield versus the current nicotine yield by a minimum of 50%. The objective has been met with both prototypes which were produced for this consumer testing. Prototype #1 utilizes a blend composed solely of low nicotine off-shore tobacco. This product achieves a smoke nicotine reduction of just over 50%. Prototype #2 uses the same base blend except that the Part II burley and flue-cured was denicotinized on the FS-2001 pilot line with a double pass to simulate a Single pass through #605. This product achieves a 63% reduction in smoke nicotine. Mailout of the test products occurred the week of 4/17; results are due 6/5. A Fourth Quarter 1989 test market introduction is planned. VANTAGE LN 85 Prototypes The objective of the VANTAGE LN is to design products which deliver 50% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. Two of the developed Prototypes are variations of the VANTAGE 100 blend, while the third Prototype is a modified WINSTON Lights/CAMEL Lights blend.

Leurene From: pr, Charles RIx OBJECT: To study means of flavoring TC devices to further augment the taste of very low tar (less than 10 mg) INTRODUCTION: New TC devices have many advantages, the most obvious of which Is lessened tar delivery. The alr dilution causes amounts of mainstream smoke to reach the consumer. Present TC have flavor, However, If tar levels were to continue to drop lower, perhaps to less than 10 mg/cigarette, lessened flavor might result. I+ Is this possible reduction In taste which makes the successful addition of flavorants to plastic TC devices desirable. PROPOSAL: I+ Is suggested that a study of flavor transfer from TC devices be initiated. The flavorant would of necessity be held In a solid matrix, ‘on an adsorbent granule or In a permeable The project would ascertain the delivery properties of model compounds such as menthol, nicotine or flavorants to the smoke.

The Society is by far the biggest of its type in the world, and typically has more than 1000 participants at the annual meeting. One of the sessions, which T have been asked to organise, is a Workshop on “The Interaction Between Radon Exposure and Smoking.\" A brief description of the workshop, and the participants, is enclosed, the former to be included in the conference program book. In light of our phone conversation, it would be most helpful and extremely appropriate if the Council for Tobacco Research could sponsor the seminary in terms of a contribution of, say, $2500, towards the travel expenses of the participants. An appropriate acknovledgement would, of course, appear in the conference program. Closer to home, ottr ovn laboratory has been doing a considerable amount of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions - which would imply that the hazard of radon + smoking is larger than the sum of the hazards from radon alone and smoking alone. Qur end point will be in-vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a seminar - or a more informal discussion - on tobacco research in general? Our laboratory has a seminar series, and a small honorarium is usual. I enclose our laboratory annual report, and my own to give you a feel for the scope of our activities.

Dear Dr. Brady, It was a pleasure to become acquainted with you at the recent FASEB meeting in Atlantic City, and as you suggested at that time, I am forwarding copies of my curriculum vitae and list of publications. Some preliminary studies in my laboratory in Australie resulted in the recent publication of a paper in Nature entitled \" Nicotine, Smoking and Cortical Inhibition \", a copy of which is enclosed. I hopefully suggest that this paper may contain some of the most significant suggestions about the psychotropic actions of nicotine to have been published and further pursuit of these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of the psychotropic actions of tobacco smoke. A comparison of the actions of ordinary and “de-nicotinised\" cigarette smoke on neurones in intact and isolated cortical areas would constitute a logical extension of my preliminary experiments, I shell ‘be moving to Winnipeg later this year to head a neuropharmacology research group, and should like to pursue these studies as suggested above. At a later stage, I should envisage a collaborative series of experiments with colleagues in the Psychology Department. at Winnipeg. If you consider that a project along these lines entitled \"A Comparison of the actions of nicotine and tobacco smoke on single neurones in the central nervous system\" would be of interest to the Council for Tobacco Research, I should be happy to submit an application for support. As mentioned during our recent conversation, I believe that this technique of recording from single neurones with multiple barrel electrodes, with which it is possible to stimlate or inhibit cells chemically, provides @ powerful tool for unraveling problems of this nature.

Box 1556 Little Rock, AR 72203 Dear Maurice, ‘The Oifice of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the US. Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation would affect just about everyplace except one’s home. ‘The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact. While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your members. It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As am certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level. Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know. Walker Mer jan TI1632-1601"

There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar | principle, ic, prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95 to 98% for smoke particles are usual claims (LR&G's 996 to 99.9% seems unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or disprove this data. I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle filters apparently clog fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If one inserts a more efficient filter, I would expect it to clog more quickly and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however, is again subject to proper I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of ‘charcoal would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose efficiency as absorbers of odors and need frequent replacement, and their brief literature describes a ‘paper film\" of charcoal, not a bank of material. T would be surprised if the odor removed efficiency stayed at 80% for 1,000 hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim. I would like to think these would work as well as they claim, but I doubt it Kindest regards, a GR/mrv —"

As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-00 (2)M on March 3, 2000 stating that certain manufacturers’ promotional programs known as “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details It is the view that any change with regard to “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs would require statutory change by the Legislature. Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the manufacturer's invoice and “buy one, get one free” (or buy some, get some free) promotions. These programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction (including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer's invoice; (2) all cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer's brands in New-York State are allowed to participate in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to specified retail dealers (other than for purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has also offered manufacturer's coupons. These are allowable under CMSA, provided that the coupon. is either published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation, or mailed directly to the consumer by the manufacturer, 8 td x 8"

I am convinced. from our work that a low antioxidant level in semen is a major risk factor for damage to sperm DNA and consequent birth defects and childhood cancer in offspring. Since smoking is a very efficient way to lower antioxidant levels, I expect that smoking will primarily damage sperm DNA through that mechanism. Our review of the epidemiology appears to bear this out. I enclose our Pittsburgh paper, where we make this case. We will continue this work to make the case as strong as we can. If smoking is only working through lowering then supplementation wih antioxdans should reverse ll of the deleterious effects on the next generation. I think this is extremely important to know and Iam committed to finding it out. If you wish to collaborate with us by collecting sperm samples from smokers and non-smokers in your company that would be very useful in speeding up the study as itis hard for us to find smokers locally. If you wish to add in a group of smokers of your presumptive safe cigarette to compare to regular smokers and non-smokers, we would be agreeable to that. ‘That might benefit you and would not be much extra work for us. If you are interested in this type of collaboration and would agree to unimpeded publication of the resuits, however they came out, we would be enthusiastic about going ahead. We would finance our end and you would do the same on your end, We believe that this is ‘work that will have a major impact on health and that it is extremely important to do as soon as possible. ‘Your letter was quite convincing that the government is not subsidizing tobacco farmers. oye \\ Bruce N.

    "text": "~ April 11, 1986 To: P. F. Ittermann RE: Moviegoer - CAMEL Perspective As requested, the following is Media's perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987. BACKGROUND Moviegoer was developed in 1982 by the 13-30 Corporation for exclusive use by the CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful Ampressions against better educated 18-34 year old males. Both Brand and Media management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization request submitted on May 7, 1981, which outlines key brand objectives. The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL's target not reached by other magazines, 2) generate Brand association/sponsorship ruboff and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment. A five-year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per year. In 1983, SALEM became a co-advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's budget. Rate increases have averaged 9% per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has remained controlled at 1.2MM per year. Moviegoer lias offered RJR a new three-year proposal (details attached). Briefly, the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be decreased from 12 to 10, the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5 g pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues). Circulation will increase 46% from 1.2MM to 1.75MM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM 8 or 150% for 2 issues). The number of markets will decrease from 127 to 100 (21%). ~ 2 RESEARCH During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer's readers. For purposes of this perspective, we will summarize key research datal Finding’ from these studies which we feel are relevant to our CAMEL perspective. Research data summarized are from the following sources: MDD's recent readership survey, 13+30'a research and movie patron demographics/ findings from industry sources."

The purpose of this Teview was to identify areas of impact, roughly estimate magnitudes of these impacts and to develop study approaches for a more detailed estimate in areas where impact appears significant. This letter summarizes the results of this preliminary review. Work done In performing this review we have studied the proposed ordinance, analyzed a similar impact study made for the State of California in connection with the proposed \"Proposition 5\", compiled data for Dade County about the number of facilities and employees in different categories which could be impacted, performed some small surveys in order to evaluate assumptions which had been made in connection with the California survey, and computed an impact using cost factors which were developed as a part of the California study adjusted for the results of our local surveys and interviews. Problems encountered Based upon our review we believe that there will be a near term cost impact in Dade County in both the Public and © Private Sectors, In attempting to quantify this impact we encountered the following difficulties: a 680047755 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

However, due to decreased funding for the period July 1977 thru June 1978, progress @ on several of the important long term aims has been sev- | erely impeded. This has resulted in a drastic change of research priorities and has necessitated the deletion of | studies pertaining to platelets from this proposal. Dr. Wu has submitted a separate proposal (including a sep- arate budget and progress report) dealing with platelets only. These are two separate, independent and unrelated proposals and should be evaluated as such. Independent budgets and possible budgetary cuts will effect either endothelial cell studies or platelet studies and will not require reallocation of decreased funds and hence decreased productivity or elimination of specific ains in either of the research areas. These two important research areas should not have to compete for available funds within the same grant proposal. We would appreciate your consideration of this problem and the tvo separate proposals. If you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me. sincerely Associate Professor 50128017"

This grant was previously assigned a #4520. The new proposal represents a revised version of the previous grant. The two reviewers had the following comments on our previous} grant (#4520). The first reviewer was extremely enthusiastic abolit our project. He considered the proposed methodology novel, predicted that it would be successful, and recommended the projéct for funding. The second reviewer, on the other hand, expressed a concerns about the P.I.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches. Per the first reviewer's comment, indeed we have successfully used positional cloning approaches and cloned BRCA2 gene as proposed in our previous application. To address the second reviewer's concern about the P.|.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches we have enclosed our latest publication describing cloning and identification of BRCA2 gene. Since the submission of our previous grant application we have cloned the gene, and hence the revised proposal has entirely different emphasis, i.e. to characterize the tumor suppressor activity of BRCA2 gene. We hope that the reviewers will favorably consider this revised proposal and give the P.|. an opportunity to continue this exciting area of research Sincerely yours, \\ poh Raj Kandpal, Ph.D. Assistant Professor"

I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for which support is sought. It should contain the following information: 1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status. 2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken, 3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Councii will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. It would also be helpful to have: 1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry. 2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30; activation is typically seven months later. Sincerely, Harmon McAllister Encl HCM/mla eee"

Long FROM: Gene Ainsworth SUBJECT: Government Relations Status Report . FEDERAL ACTIVITIES @ On October 29, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment to the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit: smoking . on commercial airline flights of 1 1/2 hours or less for a period of two years. This amenduent was substituted for Senator Lautenberg's proposal to ban smoking on flights of two hours or less for a period of three years. Earlier this year, the House approved an amendment to its version of the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less for an unlimited period of time. The two bills will now’go to a conference committee where the differences between the bills’ smoking provisions will be resolved, 2 © October 29, the House approved its budget reconciliation bill by a vote of 206 to 205. The bill raises $12.8 billion in new revenues without increasing excise taxes on cigarettes or denying deductions for tobacco product advertising and promotion expenses. The Senate is expected to consider its version of the reconciliation bill next week. Simultaneous to this action in the House and Senate are the daily Reetings of the summit between the Aduinistration and Congress. Even if we survive in the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills without a cigarette tax increase, we could still be vulnerable to an excise tax hike if the budget summit recommends revenues above that in the reconciliation bills. a 3 Fry : 3 3"

Enclosed are the corrected graphs for you and Dr. Little. You may use them any way you like, I listed the components of total respiratory so it would be clear that asthma, bronchitis, tuberculosis and respiratory cancer were included as well as emphysema and bronchitis, and that the separate rates are included in the total rates, The rates for the last two conditions are too small to consider separately. This makes quite a case for improved classification, After going down with the introduction of antibiotics, influenza and pneumonia are now going the same route as reported respiratory cancer mortality. The so called Hong Kong flu in 1968, gave that death rate another jump, so it is on the general ascendant course. My work on the longer document continues. I have all the mortality data on hand and will make a report with Bill Alban in the next two or three weeks. Thave my other file of cases completely processed for Negroes, but not quite complete for Latins and Anglos, That is, they are coded and punched, but need to be checked for duplicates. When I have the printout of the 40,000 plus cases in Houston, and compare them with the 200, 000 plus deaths from all causes, I will first check the 162, 163 classifications and see what the facts were, I have been asked to put this article in the Inter- national Journal of Cancer. The awareness that 23 years of total popula~ ton base cancer cases in Houston are available and may be checked against total deaths from all causes in Houston has caused a great deal of anticipa- tion, At the Tenth International Cancer Congress in Houston, I had a steady stream of visitors in Epidemiology; the only meetings I was able to attend"

Fackelman SUBJECT: FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: PRICE-CONSCIOUS AND PRESTIGE CATEGORIES The following white paper by Doug Weber discusses the future development of the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories. This document ie in response to your request for a “think piece” on how these two categories might develop in the next five years. In the document three separate scenarios are discussed. Each scenario differs in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories by 1988. These variations are supported by hypotheses regarding industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability, technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette consumers. Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of each scenario and the future development of the market. Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These recommendations address the need to: 1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves maximum lead-times. 2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige category. 3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions and competitive advantages. This could be done through improved technologies, more efficient distribution systems, and more effective promotional tools.

    "text": "INTEROFFICE_CORRESPONDENCE & i aie ONLY No. 458 By. September 14, 1988 en MR. R. A. KAMPE Re: Germany ~ Tax Classification It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report from the Customs Laboratory to the MOF. In a meeting this morning with three MOF officials, W. 7 Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and wore of the opinion that SPA’s characteristics were most similar to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the MOF to classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a cigarette tax rate. It was stated at the meeting that this report was preliminary and is not binding on the MOF. However, W. Dembach did not see any indication that the MOF would rule differently. The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance, Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich (the official directly in charge of RIR’s request). Absent from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s superior and has been an advocate of RJR’s position. wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a major factor in the MOF’s decision. Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He went on to say that the political issues of SPA’s investment value and social benefits were of no concern to the MOF in its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfried believes Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to recommend a cigarette tax rate. g 3 8 = a) mina"

The one exception was a 30-sheet board posted at 7th and Park which was flagging and was also by atree. Due to the limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging problem. There were also two locations that we could not find. One is indicated on the map as a new location at U.S. 67 and 167 near the I ittle Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on the map at the Junction of U.S. 70 and 130. The only 30-sheet locations near the latter point were Bordon and Camel Lights. Could you please advise the status of these two locations. Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30-sheet location located inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Rixie exit which was virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good; we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising value is worthless and, in its present condition, is probably detrimental. * Could you please check this out for us.

Genesis Packaging - TAC's retortable lidding structure is the material of choice at Genes{s, who requested 3MM square inches for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is confidential. Genesis and TAC management will meet during the second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production quantities early 1989, 2, Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting TAC 1/26-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500% permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88. Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen. 3.

Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant this week, The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new technology and markets. 4, Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with an offer of 2.0%, We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for $4MM of business and a 5,0% increase for $5MM of business. We expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by 1/29/88, 5.

We will support this increase and advise our customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and after 4/18/88, This action will also precipitate a general price increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing will determine the level and timing of this increase. a g 6.

Johnny Canales is the Tejano version of Johnny Carson who has a live entertainment show over all Univision stations featuring Tejano appigts. His show has a massive grass roote appeal and his audience is our target market, The proceeds from those attending will go to benefit the local Boys and Girls Clubs. Estimated attendance is 10,000. Although the show will be taped for a later airing date, there is no problem with our participation. We did the same type of event here in Houston in June to benefit the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and it was very successful. RECOMMENDATION I am recommending participation in this event. RATIONALE Participation in thie event will provide the Camel Brand with extensive exposure in Corpus Christi's Hispanic market in a relatively slow promotional period. In addition, participation in this event will provide the brand with an opportunity to: * Sample our target market * Distribute our premiums * Display our banners and inflatables * ~~ Set up our Camel Video Van - show our videos * Include our logo in print publicity This will also provide us with a good event for this market which has not been to active in promotional events. 8 = g 3 8 R.J.

Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102 Vice President, Operations RIR December 4, 1986 MEMO TO: Mr. Richard Morgan Director, Quality Assurance SUBJECT: Lamina Particle Size We've had several questions about why we're looking for increased particle size in stemming and there has been some work done to illustrate that larger particle size improves filling power. My position has been that we're looking for a cleaner product in pneumatic separation to reduce stem particle \"choke ups\" in high speed machinery and that we're reducing the smaller scrap level of particle size which gener- ally equates to product waste in the end. From this, if we achieve a higher filling capacity with larger particle size, that's a bonus feature. Anyway, this discussion with our Research people in Canada produced some good discussions. { 8.

I estimate that it would cost approximately $100,000 to run two (2) samples through the Drosophila assay at two labs. This is based upon Litton's price list. This appears to be prohibitive and should be limited to the minimum number of samples.

These substrates; alumina, bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black (carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes should result in decreased carbon monoxide and decomposition products. Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021\" diameter wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8\" wide x 60 mm long. _ | 08S Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at a temperature near the boiling point. One of the rods weighed .1003 g before dipping and .1820 g after dipping. Thus, .0817 g of glycerine was deposited on the aluminum spiral rod. The other spiral rod weighed .1251 before dipping and .2542 g after, thus, .1291 g of glycerine was deposited on the rod. \\ fe g SES & 2 é"

Among these were: * New Carbonyls In Smoke Method (Ayers) The new method developed by Analytical Methods has been put into routine service. Two operators have been trained to perform the analyses. No significant problems have been encountered and data have been provided for @ number of studies. Demand for these analyses has been moderate and is expected to continue at about the same rate. ¢ Low Level Menthol In Smoke (Summers) Optimization of the current method for the determinstion of the menthol content of cigarette smoke has expanded the working range to include a lower detection limit. The interest in this lower level of detection has has been the result of interest in cigarettes with menthol contents less than 0.05%, as compared with normal levels of 0.40 to 1.25%. Analyses of from cigarettes with menthol contents of 0, .07, -11, and .27 mg/cig gave deliveries of 0, .01, .02, and .04 mg/cig respectively. Tests are in progress by the Sensory Unit to determine the least detectable level by the smoking panelists. More tests may be requested, pending the results of these tests. ¢ Determination Of Wintergreen By Liquid Chromatography (Greene, Wonble) Modification of the liquid chromatographic method for the determination of licorice content of tobacco products has provided the capability to simultaneously determine the content of wintergreen in wet snuff a¢ well. This eliminates a second sample preparation by distillation and both can be quantitated from the same LC chromatogram, Also, since sample Preparation only requires an extraction, this procedure could be used on site to monitor the production of wet snuff.

Y. 10022 Dear Dr. I would like to clarify some aspects of the Research project which we submitted to the Council for Tobacco Research, in an attempt to demonstrate that our project is directly concerned with an area of cancer research which your organization is interested in supporting, i.e., the pathogenic mechanisms of oncogenesis and their control, as relates particularly to chemical carcinogenesis. We feel that the immune mechanisn is far more efficient in preventing the develop- ment of malignancies than in destroying well established growing tumors. The develop- ment of many tumors may indeed be considered, at least in part, as the result of failure of the cellular inmunity defense against tumor specific antigens. In these situations, either the least antigenic malignant cells may be permitted to grow and thus escape @ oF humoral antibodies may block specific celluler immunity. Considerable experimental evidence has been obtained in support of the considera- tions described above. As reported by ourselves and Dr. Old several years ago, it is relatively easy to demonstrate the increased resistance to tumor induction afforded by agents which stimulate the immune system, such as BOG but impossible to obtain favorable results with this type of treatment when the tumors are well established. Our purpose is to devise better methods of enhencing the immunological reactivity of host to weak tumor antigens and better techniques of stimulating selectively cellular immunity while depressing undesirable humoral immunity. Thus we plan to significantly decrease the rate of appearance of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens as well as increase the time after which they appear. We plan to use inbred mice for these studics rather than guinea pigs which we used for our studies on protection against leukemia because the mouse is clearly the animal of choice for these experiments. In addition, parallel with these studies in mice, the appearance of antibody against known viral oncogenic agents can be monitored in the sera of the experimental animals. We propose to use several inbred strains of mice, BALB/c, C57» C3H» and AKR and the following carcinogens, 3-methylcholenthrene and 3,4,-9,10-dibenzpyrene. We plan te paint or inject the carcinogen in graded doses to mice which will be subjected to various pro- cedures designed to affect the immune system and its reactivity, such as graft vs host reactions, treatment with certain bacterial extracts thet have demonstrable adjuvant efiects for cellular immunity. We will then observe the rate of appearance of the tumor in the population. In conjunction with these experiments, it seems important to us to develop a @ understanding of the mechanisms by which the inmune system manages to reject 50093420"

We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G, Gaston, attomey for D.D. Bean & Sons, Co, We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by your position, The distinctions cited in your leter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA. As we previously explained, matchbooks are within the meaning of section IIKf) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are not written or electronic Publications, Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(9. Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section TIIG) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use .. any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself” 3 g a 2 3"

Visual examination of puff shapes indicate that good replication can be achieved. Goodness of fit of repli- cated flow rate profiles to actual human profiles has improved by 50% over the data obtained from the previous cor- rection method. Replicated puff volumes and durations are within 3 to 5% of desired values. The major step to be com- pleted prior to beginning smoke regeneration work is the installation of the mathematical correction procedure on the HP-1000 computer system. A two-liter syringe required for accurate calibration of the Respitrace inhalation monitor was modified by the machine shop to provide a demountable, leak tight seal to the spirometer. Modifications to software used to control the inhalation monitor have been made which enable th syn- chronization of data acquisition from both breaths (by means of the Respitrace) and puffs (by means of the HP-1000 puff- profiling system). Once modification of the puff-profile software to provide for triggering of the Respitrace is com- pleted, data from both breaths and puffs can be acquired a simultaneously. S ="

F, Dube The results of a blind product test of fresh aftertaste (FAT) products were reported on 11/5/87. The management summary provided by MDD is included as an attachment. The products utilized the recently developed controlled release pellet technology with a low level of menthol. These products had measured smoke menthol deliveries of less than 6.5 ug/puff as compared to approx. 70 ug/puff for Salem Lt. and approx. 45 ug/puff for Newport. Three low menthol level products were tested, in which pellets containing 3%, 5% and 7% menthol by weight were inserted in the filter. No menthol was added via conventional means (i.e. top dressing, filter flavor). Products were tested among 18 - 49 year old non-menthol Full Flavor and Full Flavor Low Tar smokers, male and female. In the FF category, all three products were rated inferior on 870+ acceptance. All three products increased menthol, minty and artificial taste attributes. As we've seen repeatedly in qualitative work, FF non-menthol smokers will not accept a product if they can detect menthol. Further corroboration is provided by an earlier 1987 Concept/Product Test in which non-menthol smokers were given a concept, stating that \"a hint of menthol” was used in the products. These products were overwhelmingly rejected. In the FFLT category, the 5% menthol product was rated parity among total category and superior among 18 - 24 year old smokers and among smokers with a high fresh aftertaste ideal. The 3¢ and 78 menthol products were rated inferior to the Control among FFLT products with the 3¢ level apparently too low and the 78 level too high. For the 5% product, tobacco taste, strength and harshness attributes were maintained while fresh aftertaste and cooling aftertaste were increased. Increases in mildness, menthol, minty and artificial taste were also noticed; however, this category did not view these attributes negatively as evidenced by the positive acceptance scores. These test results are highly encouraging in view of the fact that the suspected target category for a new product with fresh aftertaste is FFLT, young adult female smokers. Additionally, the 5% menthol pellet product wes parity among category indicating that its performance was comparable to existing brands. However, it did have the aftertaste improvement a vehicle which should enhance acceptance in the FFLT category. We expect to have a product with this technology on the market within the next 12 months. s"

    "text": ": May 28, 1987 TO: R. M, Sanders FROM: M, H. Heflin RE: WINSTON Packaging Focus Group This forwards for your review the Brand's perspective on the WINSTON packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12, Background The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive suokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle, Focus groups had been held previously (March 25, 26) in Atlanta to identify ownable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or refined. With this direction, KNT Plusmark developed new packaging designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that were tested in Tampa, The information fron these latest groups will be utilized by Brand to provide further direction in the development of a design for quantitative testing and test market introduction in 1/88. Methodology Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held: @ Male WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old Female WINSTON suokers, 35 - 49 years old ¢ Female Marlboro smokers, 21 - 34 years old © Male Marlboro smokers, 21 - 27 years old e Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 34 years old Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new designs were very close to current packaging, while one \"further out\" design vas shown to see how large a change was acceptable. One set of packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor, except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red. Implications Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise groups reacted very favorably to the new designs. In fact, more radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the franchise groups, The bottom line seems to be that WINSTON’s franchise is essentially apathetic to thedr packaging. As aptly a expressed by one participant: \"WINSTON would still be WINSTON to $3 me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag.” The major Pi concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition: they © want to be able to quickly recognize and pick up their WINSTONS, 8 | 8"

Steele At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer's hand in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged cigarette residue decay study: Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer) Day 1 Day 4 Day 7 (1 week) Day 14 Day 21 Day 28 (1 month) Day 42 . Day 56 (2 months) Day 70 Day 84 (3 months). These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to Freon 123 by the August decision date.

Please note on the attached the excerpt section on the Development of the External Forecast. Specifically, this involves the procedures and notes the following areas where we need your Department's inputs. © Economic effects of cigarette pricing: My memo of February 22 to 5 you is a starting basis for discussion of this. What we need is a set of retail pricing assumptions and their estimated impact on industry volume. Jesse Siff of Siff, Oakley & Marks, an outside consulting economist, is available to work with us, if we desire. Industry undt volume and RJR volume and share: Most critical and top priority is to update since it indicates how much replanning against the market share issue is necessary. We also need to determine if there is a way to make the forecast of greater operational value to our Manufacturing and Leaf/Blend Develop- ment Departments. Manufacturing says vhat we say we will need and what we actually need end up to be quite differently.

Wagener, M.D. 21 July 1992 Associate Professor of Pediatrics University of Colorado Medical School Advisor, Coalition on Smoking OR Health and Asthma Education Technical Advisory Group American Lung Association Introduction Nearly 10,000,000 children less than five years of age living Inthe United States are exposed involuntarily to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at e Twenty-five percent of pregnant women continue to smoke throughout their pregnancy. Although the overall rate of smoking In U.S. society has been decreasing during the two and one-half decades since the Surgeon General's report on the adverse effects of tobacco, the exposure risk to young children, particularly those living in low income or black families, remains at 50-60 percent. Involuntary exposure to ETS atfects children in three different ways. First, pre- natal exposure potentially can have a marked impact on total body development including lung, brain, and size development. Additionally, premature delivery and spontaneous abortion are related to maternal smoking. Second, post-natally the growing child may have effects of ETS which impact on the heart, lungs, immune system, ears, brain, and even survival itself. Third, and possibly most important, childhood exposure to ETS impacts on the child's decision to engage in active smoking and other self-injurious medical behaviors 2 which most likely will continue into adulthood and will compound the effects of perinatal ETS exposure. : Non-Respiratory Effects The potentially injurious effects of ETS on a child's health are both non- respiratory and respiratory. Although the recently described correlation between ETS and blood cholesterol in children is significant 9, the non-respiratory effect that may be o e@ most important is the relationship between ETS and sudden infant death syndromes - 3 or SIDS - because mortality from SIDS during childhood is potentially preventibie. 5 3 The Universite of Colores isan equal opportunity action emploner"

Lyerly Machine Shop Research Department Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred. The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be essentially silicon dioxide (sand). During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 731RTV had been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. 1 recommend that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result. ‘in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided. Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed, 732RTV has been approved under FDA Regulation No. 121.2562 dealing with rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food.

Thus it contrasts with the most conventional measure of association, Product-moment lation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively. Pearson's r isbased on the product moments for each data point e@ represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted ‘sun of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore requires interval scals measuring the variables. In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points on the scales. Only tio points are represented for each variable (e.g. high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack). A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F. Schuessler, Statistical Reasoning in Sociology, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1961, pp 242-249. Sincerely, Richard J. Gagan, PhD 14705 Carnation Dr Tampa, FL 33612 50135293"
